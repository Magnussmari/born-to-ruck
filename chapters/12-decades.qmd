# Decades {#sec-decades}

The five movements do not change.

That is the first thing to understand, and perhaps the most important. The ruck stays on your back. The hinge loads the posterior chain. The carry challenges the grip and the lateral trunk musculature. The press expresses upper-body strength. The squat governs the functional range you will depend on at eighty as surely as you depend on it at thirty. The movements themselves are not in negotiation across the decades. What changes is the parameter space within which you perform them---the load, the frequency, the recovery architecture, the monitoring discipline---and the biological reasons those parameters shift are reasons worth understanding in some detail, because understanding them is what keeps you in the practice rather than sidelined by it.

This chapter is about the long arc. Not the eight-week programme. Not the twelve-week build. The arc that runs from the decade when you are maximally capable of building the physiological reserves that will determine your quality of life at seventy, all the way to the decade when drawing on those reserves constitutes the entire agenda. It is an arc measured in bone density and lean mass and cardiac volume and grip strength and the accumulated architecture of a musculoskeletal system that was treated, over a span of years, either as an asset to be developed or as a resource to be spent without replenishment.

The evidence is not ambiguous about what happens at the end of the arc. It is not a question of whether bone mineral density declines with age, or whether muscle mass atrophies without adequate mechanical and nutritional stimulus, or whether grip strength predicts all-cause mortality with a specificity that shames most clinical biomarkers. These things happen. The question is what you built before the decline began, and how deliberately you manage the rate of that decline once it is underway. The bone mineral density you have at seventy is largely a function of the deposits you made before fifty and the rate at which you drew them down in the decades that followed. The ambulatory independence you exercise at eighty---whether you rise from a chair under your own power, whether you walk without a cane, whether you live at home rather than in a facility---is a downstream consequence of choices that were available to you at forty-five and that most people at forty-five were not told they were making.

This is the chapter that tells you.

## The Bone Bank

Before the decade-by-decade account begins, a foundational concept deserves its own space, because it governs the logic of the entire arc in a way that makes everything else interpretable.

The human skeleton is not static. It is a living tissue undergoing continuous remodelling---a cycle in which osteoclasts resorb old or micro-damaged bone and osteoblasts deposit new mineralized matrix in its place. In childhood and adolescence, formation exceeds resorption, and bone mineral density rises. It peaks, depending on the skeletal site and the individual, somewhere between the late teens and the early thirties---a peak that exercise scientists have taken to calling the bone bank. The higher the peak, the larger the reserve from which the inevitable age-related net resorption will draw. The lower the peak, the sooner that resorption reaches the threshold where fracture risk becomes clinically meaningful.

What triggers osteoblast activity---what drives deposits into the bone bank---is mechanical loading applied to the skeleton in a pattern the bone perceives as novel or progressive stress. Not cardiovascular exercise per se, though some cardiovascular exercise has modest osteogenic effects. Not stretching, swimming, or cycling. Specifically, compressive loading and impact loading applied to weight-bearing bone at intensities that exceed what the bone encounters in ordinary daily movement. The stimulus needs to be above the lazy zone: below habitual loading, osteoclasts win and net resorption occurs; at habitual loading, the system is approximately in balance; above habitual loading, at a threshold that varies by individual and site, net formation occurs. The bone becomes denser, more mineral-saturated, more resistant to fracture.

Load carriage---weighted walking---applies compressive loads to the axial skeleton, the hip, and the femoral neck in exactly the pattern that osteogenic signalling requires. The load is distributed through the entire weight-bearing skeleton with every step. It is applied at a walking-pace loading rate that is mechanically far safer than running's impact transient while still exceeding the habitual unloaded walking stimulus. Qu and colleagues, working in 2020, documented paraspinal cross-sectional area increases in subjects performing structured load carriage training---a finding that extends the osteogenic case beyond cortical bone to the muscular architecture supporting the spine. The spine's resilience at seventy is partly a function of what those paraspinal muscles look like, and those muscles respond to exactly the training stimulus this book describes.

The bone bank metaphor implies urgency, and it should. Deposits become harder to make as the years advance. The anabolic hormonal environment of the twenties, with its high testosterone in men and estrogen-driven osteogenic signalling in women, supports bone formation with an efficiency that declines progressively from the early thirties onward and that drops sharply at menopause in women. You cannot replicate the deposits of your twenties at fifty. What you can do at fifty is reduce the rate of resorption, maintain what you have built, and ensure that whatever resorption occurs, it starts from a base that reflects deliberate investment rather than neglect.

## The Twenties: Building at Peak Capacity

Consider a twenty-four-year-old named Kai---a composite drawn from the exercise science literature on young adult bone development, working in logistics, spending eight to ten hours a day on his feet but not performing any structured strength or loading exercise. His cardiovascular fitness is adequate. His bone density, by DXA scan, is within the normal range for his age but sits in the lower third of it---not pathological, but not the high baseline that would serve him well at sixty. He has, in the language of the bone bank, been making minimum deposits during the decade when the interest rate is highest.

The parameters for this age group---eighteen to twenty-nine---are the most permissive in the entire lifespan table. Load carriage at thirty to forty-five percent of body weight is appropriate, achievable, and osteogenically productive for most healthy young adults in this range. Four to five sessions per week is sustainable and well within the recovery capacity of a hormonal environment characterized by relatively high testosterone in men and premenopausal estrogen and progesterone in women. The physiological objective is explicit: maximize bone mineral density before the peak and begin establishing a VO₂max base that will serve as the cardiovascular substrate for the decades that follow.

VO₂max---the maximum rate at which the body can consume oxygen during exercise---declines at approximately one percent per year from somewhere around age twenty-five onward in the absence of training. With training, that decline is substantially attenuated, but it is not eliminated. The cardiovascular reserve a thirty-year-old carries into the rest of their life is partly a function of what they built before thirty. Load carriage training, as subsequent chapters have established, drives meaningful VO₂max improvement---comparable to conventional endurance training at matched RPE---while simultaneously providing the osteogenic, muscular, and hormonal stimuli that running does not offer. The young adult who begins this practice in earnest in their twenties is not choosing between cardiovascular fitness and bone density. They are building both, with the same practice, at the age when both are most responsive to stimulus.

Kai, in the version of this story worth telling, is introduced to load carriage training at twenty-six. Not in a military context---he is not enlisting---but through a friend who has been rucking recreationally and whose enthusiasm for a Tuesday morning with a twenty-kilogram pack is infectious enough to survive initial skepticism. He starts at fifteen percent of body weight, because starting conservatively when beginning something new is wisdom rather than weakness. Within four months he is at twenty-five percent. His DXA scan at thirty will show a femoral neck T-score that represents the highest bone density he will ever have, and it will be meaningfully higher than the scan at twenty-four would have projected. The deposit is made. The interest will accrue for the next fifty years.

## The Thirties: Establishing Protocol

The thirties are a decade of consolidation. The hormonal environment remains relatively favorable---testosterone in men is declining at roughly one to two percent per year, but from a peak that, in the practicing ruckser, is higher than it would be in a habitual endurance athlete, for reasons established in earlier chapters. Estrogen and progesterone in women remain premenopausal, still supporting the osteogenic signalling that will diminish sharply in the decade to follow. The biomechanical capacity to tolerate and adapt to load is high. The acute injury risk, with appropriate programming, is low.

The objective in this decade shifts from maximum accumulation to protocol establishment. Twenty-five to thirty-five percent of body weight at three to four sessions per week is the appropriate parameter range. The volume reduction from the twenties is modest and reflects not a decline in capacity but a recognition that full-time work, relationship commitments, and in many cases the early years of parenthood create a recovery environment that is meaningfully different from the relatively unencumbered twenties. Sleep quality degrades. Stress hormone exposure increases. The total physiological load of a life is higher. Programming that ignores this context produces overreach, injury, and attrition from the practice. Programming that accounts for it---that treats the thirty-year-old as a person managing a complex competing demand structure rather than a simple training stimulus---produces adherence.

The most important thing that happens in the thirties, from the perspective of the long arc, is not the training itself. It is the identity formation around the practice. The person who arrives at forty having performed load carriage training consistently for a decade or more is not simply fitter than the person who arrives at forty having run inconsistently and injured themselves twice. They are categorically different in their relationship to the practice. The practice is not a programme they are currently following. It is a thing they do, in the way that some people pray and some people cook and some people read---a practice that is sufficiently integrated into the structure of their weeks that its absence would require explanation. This identity is the single most powerful predictor of whether the load carriage continues through the physiologically critical decade that follows.

The thirties are where the practice takes root. The forties are where the root system is tested.

## The Forties: The Most Critical Decade

There is no gentler way to say this: the decade between forty and fifty is the most consequential decade of the musculoskeletal and hormonal lifespan for both sexes, and the majority of people in that decade are not behaving as though they understand this.

For men, the testosterone decline that began in the mid-thirties accelerates into a range where its downstream effects become biologically significant. Kraemer and colleagues documented in 1999 what was at the time one of the more carefully controlled investigations of hormonal response to resistance training in older men---a study that established the magnitude of testosterone response to structured loading in a population where that response was already attenuated relative to younger subjects. The finding that matters for the present argument is not simply that testosterone rises acutely with resistance exercise---that had been documented in younger populations---but that older men retain the capacity for that acute response, and that the chronic adaptation to structured loading includes a preservation of basal testosterone that distinguishes training from non-training cohorts over time. The man in his forties who lifts heavy and carries loads is not preventing the inevitable decline in testosterone. He is maintaining the highest achievable baseline for his age and his genetics, which is the only meaningful lever available to him short of pharmacological intervention.

For women in this decade, the situation is characterized by a different set of urgencies, and they converge on the same practice recommendation through distinct biological pathways.

Perimenopause typically begins between forty-five and fifty-two, though the hormonal shifts that precede it---declining ovarian reserve, irregular progesterone production, increasingly variable estradiol levels---are often underway in the mid-forties without a clear clinical marker. The estrogenic support for bone formation that characterized the premenopausal decades is becoming unreliable. Sánchez-Trigo and colleagues, working in 2022, documented bone mineral density responses in postmenopausal women undertaking structured resistance and load-bearing exercise programs---findings that established not merely that exercise attenuated BMD loss in this population, but that the magnitude of preservation was substantially greater in women who entered the postmenopausal period with higher baseline BMD. The deposit made in the forties, before the estrogenic signal fully withdraws, is worth substantially more than an equivalent deposit attempted afterward.

This is not a narrow technical point. It is the entire argument for urgency in the forties.

Consider a woman named Renata. She is forty-three, a secondary school vice-principal, fit in the sense that she cycles to work and walks briskly and has never carried excess weight. She is not athletic in the structured sense---no gym membership, no deliberate strength training, no practice that could reasonably be called osteogenic. Her DXA scan, taken as part of a preventive health assessment, shows femoral neck and lumbar spine bone mineral density values that are normal for her age. The number is reassuring. What the number does not show her, and what her clinician does not fully explain, is that "normal for her age" represents the average of a population that is mostly not doing enough---and that the relevant question is not whether her bone density is normal but whether it is sufficient for the demands that the next three decades will place on it.

Renata begins load carriage training at forty-four. She starts conservatively---fifteen percent of body weight, two sessions per week---and builds over six months to twenty-five percent at three sessions per week, which sits comfortably within the forty to forty-nine parameter range of twenty-five to thirty percent BW at three to four weekly sessions. The first-year DXA comparison shows a statistically meaningful improvement in lumbar spine BMD and a preserved femoral neck T-score that was previously tracking downward. The clinician describes the result as impressive. Renata describes it as the moment she understood that fitness, for a woman in her mid-forties, is not about aesthetics or endurance performance or any of the things the fitness culture had spent her twenties and thirties telling her it was about. It is about the bone bank. It is about what she is building now, in this decade, before the biology of menopause restructures the terms of the transaction.

The parameters for the forty to forty-nine group carry a perimenopause-specific adjustment that deserves explicit statement. During high-symptom weeks---characterized by vasomotor symptoms, sleep disruption, significantly elevated fatigue, or mood disturbance that materially impairs recovery---the maximum load should be reduced by five percent from the calculated working load, and session RPE targets should be moderated downward by one to two points on the Borg scale. This is not permission to reduce the practice. It is a protocol adjustment that preserves the practice by preventing the overreach that high-symptom weeks can produce if the training programme ignores them. The woman who trains through a high-symptom week at unmodified intensity is not demonstrating toughness. She is accumulating a recovery deficit that will manifest as persistent fatigue, elevated injury risk, and a hormonal stress response---cortisol rising to compensate for inadequate recovery---that is precisely the wrong biological environment for the osteogenic outcomes she is training to produce.

The protein target for women in perimenopause also deserves explicit statement: an additional 0.2 grams per kilogram of body weight above the baseline recommendation, reflecting the increased protein turnover associated with the hormonal flux of this period and the elevated demand for substrate that supports both muscle protein synthesis and bone matrix production. A 68-kilogram woman at peak perimenopause is not meeting her physiological requirements with the same protein intake that served her at thirty-eight. The nutritional architecture of the practice needs to evolve with the hormonal architecture of the decade.

For both sexes in the forties, the ruck load range of twenty-five to thirty percent of body weight represents the osteogenic threshold---the minimum stimulus above habitual walking that drives net bone formation---combined with the maximum load that is sustainable without unacceptable injury risk at this stage of the lifespan. It is not the most dramatic training stimulus available. It is the one that works, applied consistently, in a decade where consistency is the variable that determines everything downstream.

## The Fifties: Defending the Capital

The fifties arrive for women with a biological event of some violence: menopause, defined retrospectively as twelve consecutive months without menstruation, typically occurring between fifty and fifty-two. In the two to three years surrounding the final menstrual period, the rate of bone mineral density loss accelerates sharply---four to eight percent per year at some skeletal sites in some women during the peri-to-postmenopausal transition, compared to the one to two percent per year that characterizes the slower rate of age-related loss in subsequent years. This is the window during which the bone bank, however well-stocked, is most vulnerable to rapid depletion.

The phrase "osteoporosis prevention" appears in the clinical literature for the fifties age group with a frequency that risks making it sound either alarming or routine, depending on the reader's relationship to the word. It is neither. It is a precise description of the primary physiological objective of structured loading exercise in this decade for women and, with less acute but still significant urgency, for men. Osteoporosis is not a disease that arrives suddenly. It is the terminus of a trajectory that is established decades earlier and that exercise, specifically osteogenic exercise, has a well-documented capacity to divert. Sánchez-Trigo and colleagues' 2022 data are relevant here precisely because they document what happens in postmenopausal women who undertake structured loading versus those who do not: the divergence in BMD trajectories is measurable and clinically meaningful within one to two years.

For both sexes in the fifties, sarcopenia---the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function---becomes a co-primary objective alongside bone preservation. Muscle mass declines at approximately three to five percent per decade from the forties onward without adequate stimulus, accelerating after sixty. The relationship between muscle mass and functional independence later in life is more direct than the relationship between any single biomarker and patient outcome in most clinical disciplines. You cannot separate "I want to maintain bone density" from "I want to maintain muscle mass" in the programming of the fifties; the exercise interventions that preserve one tend, through overlapping mechanical and hormonal pathways, to preserve the other.

The parameter shift for the fifties---twenty to twenty-eight percent of body weight at three sessions per week---reflects the need to maintain an osteogenic and myogenic stimulus while accommodating a recovery environment that is becoming genuinely more limited. This is not a concession. It is a calibration. The practitioner who is rucking at twenty-four percent of body weight three times per week in their mid-fifties, consistently and with appropriate progressive overload within those sessions, is performing a physiologically more appropriate stimulus for their biology than the practitioner who is rucking at thirty-five percent once a week and consistently underrecovering. Volume consistency over time outperforms peak intensity applied sporadically. This is a principle that applies at all ages; in the fifties it becomes more conspicuously true.

For postmenopausal women specifically, the osteogenic threshold is the absolute priority in programming decisions. Cadence in loaded walking should be managed conservatively to protect the patellofemoral joint---slower step frequencies with more deliberate loading of the posterior chain rather than the quick, shallow gait pattern that high-cadence running produces. This is partially a biomechanical protection measure and partially a mechanism for ensuring that each step delivers the compressive loading to the femoral neck and lumbar spine that is the purpose of the exercise. The patellofemoral joint in postmenopausal women is subject to increased vulnerability due to the loss of estrogenic anti-inflammatory effects; programming that ignores this vulnerability produces the kind of anterior knee pain that causes attrition from the practice at precisely the age when the practice matters most.

Consider a fifty-year-old woman named Margit, a hospital administrator, who discovers at a routine bone density scan that her lumbar spine T-score has crossed the threshold from normal into osteopenia---the pre-osteoporotic range, not yet frank disease but a clear signal that the trajectory requires intervention. Her clinician presents the finding alongside a menu of pharmacological options, calcium supplementation recommendations, and a pamphlet about fall prevention. The pamphlet does not mention load carriage training. It mentions walking and balance exercises, which are useful but insufficient to reverse a trajectory that has its roots in bone biology that walking and balance exercises do not have the mechanical intensity to alter.

Margit, through a route that does not need to be reconstructed in detail here, arrives at load carriage training with a specific, evidence-grounded understanding of why she is doing it. She is not training for fitness in the aesthetic sense. She is addressing a documented clinical finding with the most powerful non-pharmacological osteogenic intervention available to her. She tracks her load progression with the same diligence she brings to her administrative data. Within eighteen months, her follow-up DXA shows stabilization of the lumbar spine T-score and a small but statistically meaningful improvement in femoral neck density. The trajectory has changed. The capital has been defended.

The monitoring protocol that supports the fifties decade is worth articulating with precision. Heart rate variability, measured as the root mean square of successive RMS differences---RMSSD---in a two-minute morning supine reading taken before rising, provides a daily window into autonomic recovery status. Consumer-grade wearables with HRV capability have become sufficiently accurate for this purpose; the clinical precision of laboratory impedance cardiography is unnecessary when the objective is trend monitoring rather than absolute measurement. Lowe and colleagues, publishing in 2025, documented HRV adaptation patterns across age groups undertaking structured load carriage training---a study that established both the magnitude of chronic HRV improvement with consistent training and the time course of acute HRV suppression following high-load sessions that provides a reliable signal for deload decisions.

The practical protocol: a morning RMSSD reading below the individual's rolling seven-day baseline by more than eight to ten milliseconds constitutes a signal to reduce session load by twenty percent or substitute a shorter, lighter session. A reading more than eight to ten milliseconds above baseline can support a moderate increase in session intensity if other subjective markers are positive. The subjective markers---sleep quality, morning mood, perceived motivation, and the specific quality of readiness that experienced practitioners learn to recognize and that is difficult to operationalize but reliable as a self-report---corroborate or contradict the HRV signal and provide a more complete picture of recovery status than either metric alone.

### The Wearable and the Nose

A word about the readiness scores that now populate the dashboards of Oura rings, Whoop straps, Garmin watches, and their proliferating competitors.

These devices aggregate heart rate variability, respiratory rate, skin temperature, blood oxygen saturation, and sleep architecture into a single composite number that purports to tell you how hard to train on any given day. The algorithms are proprietary. The weighting is opaque. The number is presented with a confidence that the underlying signal does not always warrant. On a good day, the readiness score is a useful corroboration of what your body already knows. On a bad day, it is a number that contradicts your lived experience and leaves you wondering which signal to trust.

Here is the answer: trust the nose.

The nasal gate operates in real time, on the trail, under actual load, in the conditions that matter. It integrates everything the wearable is trying to approximate---autonomic status, cardiovascular reserve, respiratory efficiency, cumulative fatigue---and it does so with a feedback latency of approximately one breath. If your wearable says you are recovered but your nose says you are in Zone 3 at a pace that was Zone 2 last Tuesday, the nose is correct. Your autonomic nervous system is communicating directly through the nasal airway's capacity to meet ventilatory demand. The wearable is communicating through an algorithm that processed last night's data.

This is not an argument against wearables. HRV trend data across weeks and months is genuinely valuable for identifying accumulated fatigue before it becomes injury. The morning RMSSD reading described above provides a recovery signal that the nose cannot offer while you are lying in bed. The wearable and the nose serve different temporal windows: the wearable monitors the overnight recovery; the nose monitors the real-time session.

When they agree, train as planned. When they disagree, the nose wins. It has been calibrated by three and a half million years of loaded locomotion. The algorithm was calibrated last quarter.

## The Sixties: The Architecture of Function

The sixties bring a reconfiguration of objectives that is important to name explicitly, because naming it helps practitioners in this decade stay engaged with the practice rather than measuring themselves against a standard that no longer applies.

The primary physiological objectives in the sixties, for both sexes, are fall prevention, continued sarcopenia resistance, and cardiovascular disease risk mitigation. Each of these deserves brief elaboration, because each has a specific mechanistic connection to load carriage training that is not always self-evident.

Fall prevention is, in epidemiological terms, the single most consequential intervention available for the reduction of morbidity and mortality in adults over sixty-five. Hip fracture in this population carries a one-year mortality rate of approximately twenty-five percent in women and higher in men---a statistic that makes the orthopedic ward a more dangerous destination than many cancers, and one that receives proportionally less public health attention because it lacks the narrative coherence of a disease. Load carriage training improves fall prevention through at least three distinct mechanisms: it improves grip strength, which is consistently associated with reduced fall risk and is a proxy for the whole-body neuromuscular coordination that prevents stumbles from becoming falls; it improves balance through the proprioceptive demand of walking with a distributed load on the torso; and it maintains the lower-extremity muscle mass and power that determines whether a momentary loss of balance is recoverable or catastrophic.

The sixty-five-year-old man named Edmund, who has been rucking consistently since his mid-forties, does not think of himself as a person engaged in fall prevention. He thinks of himself as a person who walks with a pack on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday mornings, who has done this for twenty years, and whose grip dynamometry reading at his most recent physical was in the seventy-fifth percentile for his age group---a finding his physician noted with some surprise, having expected worse. Edmund's grip strength is not the consequence of grip-specific training. It is the incidental product of twenty years of carrying loaded straps against the resistance of a moderately heavy pack. The tendons and intrinsic hand musculature have been maintaining their architecture under load while his peers who walked without weight experienced the slow atrophic drift that unloaded tissue undergoes without regular mechanical demand.

The parameter shift for the sixties---fifteen to twenty-two percent of body weight at three sessions per week---reflects a changed recovery landscape and a different injury risk calculus rather than a changed biological purpose. The training is still osteogenic at this range, still myogenic, still sufficient to maintain or improve grip strength, still cardiovascularly productive. It is calibrated to the reality that recovery from a high-load session in a sixty-two-year-old takes meaningfully longer than it takes in a forty-two-year-old, and that the risk of connective tissue injury---tendons and ligaments adapting more slowly than muscle in response to progressive load---rises with the magnitude of the load stimulus. The twenty-percent of body weight session that a sixty-five-year-old completes three times per week with good form and appropriate recovery is producing more total adaptation than the thirty-percent session they attempt once per week while managing the ankle tendinopathy it produced.

The minimum effective dose for the sixty-five-plus group---thirty minutes at three sessions per week at fifteen percent of body weight---is a floor, not a ceiling. It is the minimum stimulus the evidence supports as sufficient to maintain the functional outcomes that matter for quality of life in this decade. Practitioners who are capable of more and who are recovering well from it should do more, within the parameter ceiling. Practitioners whose cumulative life circumstances---competing health conditions, inadequate sleep, high stress loads, a history of injury or undertraining---place them closer to the floor should meet the floor consistently rather than aspiring to the ceiling inconsistently.

---

## The Seventies: The Minimum Effective Dose

If the forties are the most critical decade for making deposits into the bone bank, the seventies are the decade when the account statement arrives and the mathematics of what was accumulated and what was spent become impossible to ignore.

Frailty is the clinical concept that captures what the mathematics produce when the balance is inadequate. It is not merely weakness or age. It is a physiological syndrome of accumulated deficit across multiple systems---muscle, bone, immune, cardiovascular---that produces a measurable vulnerability to adverse health outcomes disproportionate to the underlying disease burden. The Fried frailty phenotype, the dominant clinical taxonomy, identifies five markers: unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, slow gait speed, and weak grip strength. Three or more markers define frailty. Two markers define pre-frailty, which carries its own substantial risk elevation. Grip strength is in the phenotype not because it is the most consequential of the five but because it is the most easily measured proxy for the whole-body muscle function that the other markers express differently.

The parameter range for the seventies---ten to eighteen percent of body weight at two to three sessions per week---is designed around a single governing principle: maintain the minimum osteogenic and myogenic stimulus sufficient to prevent frailty syndrome progression while respecting the substantially diminished recovery capacity of this decade. The practitioner in their seventies is not training for performance. They are training for function. The functional outcomes they are training for are specific: walk without falling, rise from a chair without assistance, carry a bag of groceries, descend stairs with confidence, maintain the proprioceptive acuity that makes navigating irregular terrain possible without constant conscious attention.

These are not modest objectives. They are the objectives that determine whether a person at eighty lives at home or in a care facility. They are the objectives that determine whether a person at seventy-five takes a bus or waits for someone to drive them. They are the objectives that the exercise science literature has established, with considerable consistency, are meaningfully responsive to structured loading exercise even in octogenarians---which means that the practice delivers returns on investment at every point in the lifespan where it is undertaken.

The HRV monitoring protocol remains relevant and becomes more important in the seventies, because the signal-to-noise ratio between appropriate and excessive training load narrows. The margin between the dose that produces adaptation and the dose that produces injury becomes smaller, and the HRV metric---combined with the subjective markers of sleep quality, motivation, and morning readiness---becomes the practitioner's most reliable navigation instrument. Deload weeks, in which load is reduced by twenty-five to thirty percent from the working level for a full week, should occur on a three-to-four-week rhythm as a default, with additional deloads triggered by sustained HRV suppression or subjective indicators of accumulated fatigue. The deload is not a week off. It is a week of reduced stimulus that allows supercompensation to occur---the biological process in which the body, given adequate recovery, adapts to a level above its previous baseline. Skipping deloads in the name of consistency produces the opposite of what the practitioner intends.

## The Eighties: The Return on Investment

The eighty-year-old whose ambulatory independence depends on the bone bank deposits made at forty-five is not a hypothetical. She is the person that the entire preceding arc of this chapter has been building toward. She is the specific, concrete, demonstrable outcome of a practice that was undertaken, perhaps, without full awareness of its long-term implications---undertaken because it felt good, or because a friend did it, or because a book explained why it was worth doing---and that accumulated, over decades of consistent application, into a physiological reserve that is now the difference between a life of functional independence and a life organized around the limitations of a body that was not prepared for its own duration.

The parameter range for the eighties and beyond---eight to twelve percent of body weight at two to three sessions per week---sounds almost trivially light. It is not. At this age, the osteogenic threshold is lower because the bone is more sensitive to mechanical loading signals, and because the relevant comparison is not a younger adult's training stimulus but an unloaded walking practice, or no walking practice at all. Eight to twelve percent of body weight applied consistently to the weight-bearing skeleton of an eighty-year-old, three times per week, over the course of a year, produces measurable and clinically meaningful preservation of bone mineral density at sites where fracture risk is concentrated---the femoral neck, the vertebral bodies, the distal radius. It produces measurable preservation of the muscle mass that supports posture and balance. It maintains the grip strength that the Fried phenotype identifies as a frailty marker.

The practitioner at eighty-plus is not performing the same exercise as the twenty-six-year-old who carried a twenty-kilogram pack through an October forest. They are performing a scaled version of the same practice, with the same five movements at the center of it, calibrated to the biology of their decade rather than abandoned in favor of something gentler and less effective. The scaling is not surrender. It is the application of intelligence to the long arc of a practice that was never supposed to be a phase.

---

## The Deload Rhythm

Across all decades, the deload rhythm deserves treatment as a structural feature of the practice rather than an optional modification.

The three-to-four-week deload cycle operates as follows: three weeks of progressive loading, in which total session load or weekly volume increases modestly week-over-week within the parameter range for the decade; one week at approximately seventy percent of the preceding week's load, in which frequency is maintained but intensity is deliberately reduced. This is not intuitive to practitioners accustomed to thinking of progress as a function of continuous accumulation. It is, however, consistent with what the exercise science literature documents about supercompensation: the adaptation response that follows adequate training stress and adequate recovery is greater than the response that follows training stress without recovery, and the practitioner who deloads on a structured rhythm will outperform the practitioner who trains through without deloads, measured over months or years rather than weeks.

HRV provides the real-time signal that modulates the deload rhythm around its structural default. If the week-three HRV data show sustained suppression---morning RMSSD readings consistently below the seven-day baseline---the deload begins in week three rather than week four. If week three shows elevated HRV and all subjective markers are positive, the loading week can extend into a modest week four before deloading in week five. The rhythm is the default; the HRV is the adjustment mechanism; the subjective markers are the corroboration. Together they constitute a monitoring protocol that is practically achievable with consumer technology and does not require laboratory infrastructure or clinical oversight.

Lowe and colleagues' 2025 findings on HRV adaptation in load carriage training populations provide the validation substrate for this monitoring approach. The study documented that chronic HRV improvement---the adaptation of autonomic regulatory capacity to training stress---occurred across age groups and was preserved in older cohorts who applied structured deload protocols, while it was attenuated or absent in cohorts whose training was continuous without recovery weeks. The deload is not rest. It is the mechanism by which the training produces lasting adaptation rather than accumulated damage.

## The Table Made Human

The decade-by-decade parameter table that appears in the appendix of this book---the numbers that govern load, frequency, protein targets, and monitoring thresholds across the lifespan---is a compression of evidence. It is, in its numerical form, a useful reference document. But a reference document is not the same as an argument, and the argument this chapter has been constructing is not ultimately about numbers.

The argument is about permanence.

It is about the distinction between a programme---a finite intervention with a defined end date and a specific outcome objective---and a practice, which is a habitual engagement with a set of movements that does not end because the movements are not contingent on a specific life phase or a specific performance goal. Running is a programme for most people: something they do intensely for a period, then abandon following injury or loss of motivation or the arrival of a competing life demand, then perhaps resume, then perhaps abandon again. The injury rate predicts this. The average recreational runner's training history, reconstructed through a sufficiently long interview, is typically a series of episodes rather than a continuous thread.

Load carriage training, as this book has been arguing from its opening pages, is structured differently. The movements are functional rather than performative. The load is a parameter rather than an identity---you are not a person who runs fast or far; you are a person who carries weight on their back while they walk, and the weight adjusts as the decade adjusts, and the walking continues. The practice is compatible with urban life and rural life, with schedules that include children and jobs and travel, with the reduced recovery capacity of the fifties and the changed biomechanical landscape of the seventies. It scales because its central element---walking---is the movement the human body performs until it stops performing any movements at all.

The five movements do not change. The pack, the hinge, the carry, the press, the squat. At twenty-six, you perform them at twenty-five percent of your body weight four times a week. At forty-six, you perform them at twenty-eight percent three times a week, with a protein target calibrated to perimenopause if that is your decade's biology. At sixty-six, you perform them at eighteen percent three times a week, monitoring your HRV every morning before you rise, respecting the deload signal when it comes. At seventy-eight, you perform them at ten percent twice a week, and the total duration of each session is thirty minutes, and you rise from the session with a body that knows it has done something useful---a body that has made the deposits that will sustain the independence it expects to exercise next year and the year after that.

This is the practice. Not the programme---the practice. Not the twelve-week challenge or the event registration or the before-and-after photograph. The practice that begins when you first put on the pack and that ends, if it ends, when you decide it ends---not when the biology of aging decides it ends, not when the injury catalogue of an incompatible exercise accumulates to the point of defeat, not when the culture stops selling you the equipment. When you decide. Because the practice, calibrated correctly to the decade you occupy, is still producing returns at eighty.

The bone bank deposits made at forty-five do not know they were made by someone who was busy, or tired, or uncertain whether the practice would stick. They are in the account regardless. They are compounding.

Put on the pack.

## A Note on Sex-Specific Scaling

The chapter has woven sex-specific adjustments into the decade accounts rather than segregating them, because the evidence supports integration rather than separation: both sexes share the same five movements, the same osteogenic mechanisms, the same sarcopenia risk, the same fall-prevention imperative. The differences are in the parameters and the biological timing, not in the practice itself.

For women, the perimenopause transition between forty-five and fifty-two represents the most acutely time-sensitive window in the entire lifespan table. The osteogenic hit delivered in this period---the maintained or improved BMD that results from consistent load carriage training through the hormonal flux of perimenopause---is the single most important investment a woman in her forties can make against the fracture risk that menopause will otherwise accelerate. The protein addition of 0.2 grams per kilogram above baseline during this period is not optional nutritional advice; it is substrate for the bone matrix production that the training stimulus is calling for. The five-percent load reduction during high-symptom weeks is not accommodation; it is the programming intelligence that keeps the practice viable across a period when the temptation to either push through inappropriately or abandon the practice altogether is highest.

For postmenopausal women, the osteogenic threshold is the organizing priority of all programming decisions. The patellofemoral joint protection through managed cadence is a durable component of the protocol, not a temporary modification. The monitoring frequency for DXA should be annual during the first five years post-menopause and biennial thereafter, with the scan data used as a direct feedback mechanism for programming decisions rather than simply as a report to be filed.

For men, the testosterone-preserving effects of load carriage training---documented in the resistance training literature through Kraemer and colleagues' 1999 work and elaborated in the more recent hormonal exercise science that Chapter 6 of this book addresses at length---become a primary objective in the forties and fifties, when the natural testosterone decline is accelerating and the gap between training and non-training cohorts in basal testosterone levels is growing. The man who arrives at sixty with the testosterone profile of a sixty-year-old who has been lifting and carrying for twenty years is in a fundamentally different physiological situation than the man who arrives at sixty with the profile of someone who ran himself into EHMC suppression for a decade and then stopped exercising because the knee gave out. Both are sixty. The practices they brought to sixty are not equivalent, and the bodies they inhabit at sixty reflect that.

## The Architecture of a Long Life

The emotional truth of this chapter---the truth that underlies all of the numbers and all of the composite stories and all of the mechanistic explanations---is that the body is not a consumer product with a planned obsolescence date. It is a structure that responds to how it is treated across time, and that responds in ways that are more predictable, more modifiable, and more consequential than the culture of acute fitness interventions has ever been organized to communicate.

Decades is the word that matters. Not weeks. Not the twelve-week programme that the fitness industry's economic model is organized around, because twelve-week programmes require twelve-week repurchases and the industry needs you to be perpetually re-beginning rather than steadily continuing. Decades. The arc from the bone bank deposits of the twenties to the ambulatory independence of the eighties, visible in its entirety only from the vantage point of time but navigable at each point with the information this chapter has tried to provide.

The practice is already old. Humans carried loads on their backs across savannas and mountain passes and river crossings long before anyone measured a T-score or calculated a VO₂max. The practice does not belong to the fitness industry. It belongs to the body that was built for it. You have had the body all along. What this chapter is offering is the map of how to use it, across all of the decades you are given, with the intelligence the evidence has accumulated and the permanence that the body, asked honestly, has been requesting from the beginning.

The same five movements. Every decade. Scaled, not abandoned.

That is the practice. That is the road.
