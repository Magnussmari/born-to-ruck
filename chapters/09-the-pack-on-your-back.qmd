# The Pack on Your Back {#sec-pack}

A backpack is the most underrated piece of exercise equipment in existence.

Not a barbell. Not a treadmill. Not a cable machine or a Peloton or a heart rate monitor that syncs to an app that syncs to your doctor's server. A backpack. The same object a twelve-year-old carries to school. The same object that has been strapped to human torsos for ten thousand years of civilization, and — if you accept the evolutionary argument of the chapters before this one — for the three and a half million years before that.

It costs nothing to use. It requires no membership, no reservation, no special shoes. It works on pavement and gravel and grass and mountain trails. It scales from a five-kilogram beginner's load to a forty-kilogram military standard. And it trains the exact motor pattern that your musculoskeletal system was shaped by evolution to perform — weighted bipedal locomotion, nose breathing, at a pace you can sustain for hours.

Every preceding chapter was the case for why. This one is the how.

What follows is a complete protocol. Not a suggestion. Not a starting point from which you will graduate to something harder and more complex. The protocol itself is complete. Rucking does not require a second modality to work. You will add four companion movements in the next chapter — farmer carries, dead hangs, push-ups, a deep rest squat — but those are complements, not prerequisites. The loaded walk is the thing. Everything else is accessory.

What you need to leave this chapter with is the following: which pack to buy, how to load it, how heavy to start, how to progress the load across weeks and months, how fast to walk, how to know if you are in the right intensity zone, what to do when you are not, and how to manage fatigue across a training year. You also need to understand one physiological gate that governs all of it — the gate you have been building toward since Chapter 8.

Your mouth stays closed. Everything else follows from that.

## Before You Load: Red Flags

Before progressing through the load protocols in this chapter, read the Red Flags section in Appendix A. The following symptoms require immediate cessation and medical evaluation: sharp joint pain during or after rucking, numbness or tingling in the extremities under load, chest pain or pressure, dizziness, and any pain that worsens session to session rather than improving. This protocol is designed to build you. If it is breaking you, the load is wrong, the progression is wrong, or something clinical needs attention first.

## The Pack

Let us start with the object itself, because most people make the selection decision badly. They either buy something too cheap — a daypack with no structure, no hip belt, load sitting low and swinging — or they buy something too technical, a purpose-built military ruck that costs two hundred dollars and is designed for thirty kilograms of gear in a combat context where comfort is secondary to load capacity. Neither extreme serves the person beginning a rucking practice for health and longevity.

The requirement is simpler than the marketplace suggests: an internal frame pack with a functioning hip belt, sized between twenty and thirty-five litres, with a torso-length adjustment that allows the top of the bag to reach the base of your neck when the hip belt is cinched correctly. That is the entire specification. The price range that satisfies it runs from forty to one hundred and fifty dollars. You do not need more.

The internal frame matters because it positions the load against your back rather than holding it away from your body. When the load rides close to your spine, its centre of mass stays near your body's own centre of mass, and the mechanical moment arm — the lever arm through which the pack tries to pull you backwards — remains short. A frame that rides away from your back extends that moment arm and forces the erector spinae to work much harder to maintain upright posture. At low loads this is tolerable. At twenty percent of body weight and above, it becomes a drag force against every step you take.

The hip belt matters differently depending on load. At loads below roughly fifteen to twenty percent of body weight — the loads you will carry in your first two to four weeks of the protocol — the hip belt is primarily a stabiliser, holding the pack from swinging side to side during the gait cycle. At loads above twenty percent of body weight, the hip belt becomes load-bearing infrastructure. When cinched correctly against the iliac crest, it transfers a substantial fraction of the pack weight from your shoulders and cervical spine to your pelvis and legs, which are far better suited architecturally to bear it. The iliac crest is a shelf. Evolution spent millions of years engineering it to do exactly this. Use it.

How to cinch the hip belt correctly: stand upright, let the pack hang against your back, and tighten the hip belt until it sits over the crest of your iliac bone — not on your waist, not on your lower abdomen, but on the bony ridge of your pelvis. It should feel snug without constricting breathing. Then tighten the shoulder straps until the pack is pulled close to your back, with a small gap — roughly one to two finger-widths — between your shoulders and the straps. The load-lifter straps, if your pack has them, angle from the top of the shoulder straps to the top of the pack and should pull the upper portion of the load inward at roughly forty-five degrees. Tighten them last.

Where in the pack the load sits matters as much as the belt. Dense, heavy items — whatever you are using as ballast — belong high and close to your back. The ideal position is centered on your upper thoracic spine, roughly at the level of your shoulder blades. This keeps the centre of mass of the loaded pack near your own centre of mass, minimising the moments of force around your lumbar spine and reducing the forward trunk lean that heavy loads imposed on the lower back would otherwise demand.

Dahl and colleagues measured what happens to posture when this principle is violated or simply not understood. In their 2016 study of participants walking with loads up to twenty-five percent of body weight, they documented a forward trunk lean of approximately fourteen degrees and a compensatory head-forward posture change of approximately thirteen degrees at maximum load — both of which compound each other, since a forward-leaning head creates a secondary moment arm at the cervical spine. A fifteen-kilogram head hanging twelve centimetres forward of the shoulders requires the posterior cervical musculature to produce dramatically more force than a head balanced over the spine. The corrective is high thoracic load placement plus a conscious lengthening of the crown of the head toward the sky — not a military snap-to-attention stiffness, but a gentle reminder to the cervical extensors that they exist. Check your position every five to ten minutes in the early weeks, particularly on uphills, where the lean reflex intensifies.

What to use as ballast if you do not want to buy weight plates or sandbags: water bottles, books, canned food, a bag of rice inside a dry bag inside the pack. Anything dense that fits the upper portion of the bag and does not shift with movement. Weight distribution matters more than the source of the weight. If you feel the load swinging or shifting when you walk, add a compression strap or redistribute the contents. A moving load amplifies ground reaction forces at heel strike and alters your gait mechanics in ways that accumulate over an hour-long session.

## The Load

You start at ten percent of body weight. No exceptions.

This is not a cautious opening bid that will embarrass you when you discover how easy it is. At ten percent of body weight, on a forty-five-minute walk, the first-time rucker will likely find that this is enough. The metabolic demand is already substantially higher than unloaded walking. The posterior chain — erectors, glutes, hamstrings — is activated differently than it is during unloaded walking, and the novel pattern of recruitment produces a fatigue distinct from anything you have felt before. The calves are doing more work because the ground reaction force at heel contact has increased. The hip flexors are decelerating a heavier load with every step. None of this is excessive at ten percent. All of it is sufficient to initiate adaptation.

Looney and colleagues, in research published in 2024, provided updated equations for the metabolic cost of load carriage that capture the nonlinear relationship between load and energy expenditure. Their data confirm what the Pandolf equation predicted decades earlier: load has a multiplicative, not additive, effect on metabolic rate. An eighty-kilogram person walking at five kilometres per hour with no load expends roughly three hundred and fifty calories per hour. Add eight kilograms — ten percent of body weight — and that figure rises to approximately five hundred calories per hour. Add sixteen kilograms — twenty percent — and you approach six hundred and fifty. The load does not merely add its own weight to the calculation; it changes the mechanics of every step, increasing joint reaction forces, muscle activation requirements, and therefore the oxygen cost of movement across the entire kinetic chain.

The progression formula is simple, and it is enforced by physiology rather than will.

**Males:** Start at ten percent of body weight. Add two kilograms per two-week block.

**Females:** Start at ten percent of body weight. Add two kilograms per three-week block.

The sex difference in progression timing reflects the higher rate of bone stress injury documented in female military trainees under rapidly escalating load regimens, combined with the baseline differences in tendon stiffness and ligamentous laxity that affect injury risk across the lower limb. It is not a statement about capacity — female ruckers routinely train at the same absolute loads as males, and the longitudinal outcomes are comparable — but about the time required to build the connective tissue base that supports heavy loaded walking without accumulating microdamage faster than repair can follow.

Both progressions answer to the same gate: if nasal breathing becomes uncomfortable at the new load, you do not progress. You return to the previous load for one additional two-week block and attempt the increase again. This is not failure. This is the protocol working. The nasal gate is not a nice-to-have feature of the Akureyri Protocol — it is the autoregulating mechanism that prevents the programme from accumulating stress faster than it produces adaptation. The temptation to override it with a mouth breath, or to tell yourself that your breathing is fine when it clearly is not, is precisely the temptation the gate exists to resist. Breathe through your nose. If you cannot, slow down. If slowing down means falling below the target pace, do so. The pace target is secondary to the breathing gate. Always.

## The Three Phases

The protocol unfolds across six months in three distinct phases. These phases are not arbitrary divisions of a continuous curve; they correspond to the physiological time constants of the adaptations you are building.

**Phase One: Weeks One Through Four**

Load: ten to fifteen percent of body weight.
Duration: thirty to forty-five minutes per session.
Frequency: two sessions per week.

Phase One is the connective tissue phase. Its purpose is not primarily cardiovascular or metabolic — those adaptations will begin immediately, but they are not the limiting factor in week one. The limiting factor is the tendons, ligaments, and bone of the lower limb adapting to a load pattern they have not experienced before, or have not experienced recently. Tendon remodelling in response to mechanical loading occurs on a time scale of weeks to months, not days. The bone mineral density response to axial loading follows a similarly extended timeline. You cannot rush these adaptations by training harder; you can only supply the stimulus and wait.

The practical experience of Phase One is that the sessions are easier than you expected. This is not an error. By the end of week four, you should be completing forty-five-minute sessions at fifteen percent of body weight with nasal breathing comfortable and RPE sitting at eleven to thirteen on the Borg twenty-point scale — perceived as "fairly light" to "somewhat hard," which maps onto sixty to seventy percent of heart rate maximum, which maps onto blood lactate below two millimoles per litre. If you wear a heart rate monitor, check the number. If you do not own one, perform the talk test: at correct intensity, you should be able to speak in complete sentences without pausing to breathe. A word or two at a time means you are too hard. If you feel you could carry on indefinitely, you may need to add load or pace.

**Phase Two: Weeks Five Through Twelve**

Load: eighteen to twenty-two percent of body weight.
Duration: forty-five to sixty minutes per session.
Frequency: three sessions per week.

Phase Two is the cardiovascular and metabolic phase. Adding the third weekly session increases the cumulative aerobic stimulus substantially — three sessions at twenty percent load and sixty minutes apiece produces weekly training volumes comparable to Zone 2 running programmes that elite endurance coaches prescribe for aerobic base development, but without the per-kilometre mechanical stress that accumulates to injury in runners at equivalent cardiovascular loads.

At twenty percent of body weight, the Santos and colleagues 2021 data become relevant. Their measurements of dynamic joint stiffness during load carriage at thirty percent of body weight showed significant increases at the ankle (p = 0.002) and knee (p < 0.001) compared to unloaded walking, with the stiffening representing a structural adaptation — the joint becoming more resistant to deformation under load — rather than a pathological change. At twenty percent, the same process is underway to a lesser degree. The joints are being trained as well as the heart and lungs.

This is also the phase where pace begins to matter in a more structured way. The target at Phase Two is a comfortable walking pace that maintains nasal breathing. For most people, this falls between four-point-eight and five-point-five kilometres per hour on flat terrain. You will slow on uphills — that is correct and expected — and accelerate on descents, where ground reaction forces increase enough that a controlled gait becomes more important than maintaining target speed. Pay attention to the uphill: it is where the lean reflex activates and the head begins to migrate forward. Counter it consciously.

By the end of Phase Two, twelve weeks into the protocol, you will have accumulated approximately thirty to thirty-six structured sessions. Your resting heart rate will likely have fallen. Your gait under load will feel natural in a way it did not in week two. The pack will feel like part of your body rather than an object strapped to it. This shift in perception is biomechanically meaningful: when the pack feels integrated, your neuromuscular system has learned to include its mass in the kinematic model it uses to plan and execute each step. You are, at that point, carrying efficiently.

**Phase Three: Months Four Through Six**

Load: twenty-five to thirty percent of body weight.
Duration: sixty to ninety minutes per session.
Frequency: three to four sessions per week.

Phase Three is the threshold where the protocol's osteogenic effects reach maximum potency. The combination of load — twenty-five to thirty percent of body weight — and walking speed — targeting at least one-point-five metres per second, or five-point-four kilometres per hour, by the end of Phase Three — produces the ground reaction force profile that exercise physiologists describe as meeting the two-times-body-weight osteogenic threshold at the hip and spine. The work by Wall-Scheffler and the broader load carriage literature confirm that this is the loading zone in which walking transitions from a maintenance stimulus for bone into a bone-building stimulus for bone. Below it, you preserve what you have. At it and above it, you accumulate.

Nilsson and Thorstensson's foundational 1989 measurements of ground reaction force across walking and running speeds established the baseline: unloaded walking produces peak vertical forces of one to one-point-five times body weight, while running generates two to two-point-nine times body weight with a sharp impact transient absent in the walking gait cycle. A loaded walk at twenty-five to thirty percent of body weight at one-point-five metres per second sits at approximately one-point-six to one-point-eight times total system mass — above the unloaded walking stimulus, below the running impact loading rate. The stimulation is sufficient for osteogenesis. The loading rate is safe for joint longevity. This is the rucking sweet spot.

The speed target of one-point-five metres per second at Phase Three is not a hard floor. It is a direction of travel. Some days terrain, fatigue, or weather will put you below it. What matters is that pace is not artificially limited by timidity about the load. If your nasal breathing is comfortable — which it should be, because you have spent three months adapting to it — and your RPE is in the eleven-to-fourteen range, you should be walking at a genuine pace rather than a shuffling pace. Move like you have somewhere to be.

## The Nasal Gate

By now you understand the physiology well enough that it does not need to be re-explained in full. Chapter 8 covered the mechanism. This section addresses the practical implementation of nasal breathing within the rucking protocol.

The rule is one sentence: if you cannot maintain comfortable nasal-only breathing at your current load and pace, slow down first, and if slowing down is not sufficient, drop the load.

Comfortable does not mean effortless. At twenty percent of body weight on a hill, nasal breathing requires effort — you will feel the additional airway resistance of the nose relative to the mouth, and that resistance is not nothing. What comfortable means is that the breathing is controlled, rhythmic, and sustainable. You are not fighting for each breath. You are not consciously suppressing the urge to open your mouth. The rhythm is slow enough that your diaphragm has time to complete both its respiratory function and its postural stabilisation function before the next breath begins.

Panizzolo and colleagues, in their 2016 work on metabolic power during loaded locomotion, quantified how metabolic demand scales with load and speed in ways that put a practical ceiling on the pace at which nasal breathing remains comfortable for a given load. For most people in Phase One and early Phase Two, that ceiling is encountered not at the pace target but when the terrain changes — when the trail turns uphill and the metabolic cost per step suddenly jumps. The uphill is the nasal gate stress test. If you can maintain nasal breathing on a moderate incline with your current load, your intensity is calibrated correctly for the protocol. If the uphill forces a mouth breath, it tells you that you are operating near the boundary of your current aerobic capacity at that load, which is useful information.

The formal intensity verification targets are these: nasal breathing comfortable; RPE eleven to fourteen on the Borg scale; heart rate between sixty and seventy-five percent of maximum (age-predicted maximum is two-hundred-and-twenty minus age, though this formula has substantial individual variability); blood lactate below two millimoles per litre if you ever have access to a measurement device. In the absence of a heart rate monitor or lactate meter, the nasal gate alone is a reliable proxy for all of them. If the nose is open and the breathing is controlled, the rest of the physiology follows.

The adaptation to nasal breathing during exercise follows a timeline. Dallam and colleagues demonstrated in their 2018 study that recreational runners who had trained exclusively with nasal breathing for at least six months showed no significant difference in VO₂max compared to oral breathing — the ten percent performance deficit that non-adapted subjects show in acute nasal restriction trials had disappeared entirely, while the ventilatory efficiency gains remained. For loaded walking, which operates at forty-five to fifty percent of VO₂max rather than the eighty-five percent intensities of competitive running, the adaptation requirement is lower. Most people find that the nasal gate feels natural within four to six weeks of consistent practice. In the early days, you may feel like you are breathing through a straw. By week six, the nose will feel like the obvious route, and a mouth breath during a ruck will feel like a signal that something has gone wrong.

It has. Slow down.

## Gait Under Load

The loaded walk is not a march. It is not a power walk. It is not a normal walk with extra weight. It is a distinct locomotor pattern, and understanding its mechanics will make you both more efficient and less likely to accumulate the kind of repetitive stress that sidelines ruckers who ignore what the body is doing.

Begin with the feet. The heel strike that characterises most recreational walking — where the heel makes contact first and the force is transmitted up the leg in a characteristic double-peak pattern — is appropriate and correct for loaded walking. You are not trying to become a midfoot striker. Nilsson and Thorstensson's 1989 ground reaction force data established that the walking gait cycle produces its characteristic double-peak vertical force profile regardless of load, with peak forces at ten percent of body weight load remaining well below the impact transient that defines running at any speed. The heel strike is the gait cycle working correctly. Let it work.

What changes under load is the time you spend in the stance phase — the portion of the gait cycle when one foot is in contact with the ground. Under heavy load, the body naturally lengthens the stance phase and shortens the swing phase, reducing the brief moments when the entire body mass plus the pack mass is unsupported in flight. This is not a flaw; it is an adaptation that reduces peak ground reaction forces at a given speed. You do not need to consciously manage it. Your nervous system will do it for you.

What you do need to manage consciously, at least in the early weeks, is the relationship between load and trunk angle. The instinct under heavy load — particularly on uphills — is to hinge forward at the hips, dropping the torso toward horizontal. This shortens the effective moment arm between the pack's centre of mass and the hip joint, which feels like it reduces effort, and it does in the short term. But sustained forward lean compresses the lumbar discs asymmetrically and shifts the extensor load from the gluteus maximus — the most powerful muscle in the body, capable of sustained work for hours — to the lumbar erector spinae, which fatigue more quickly and are not built for prolonged loaded effort.

The cue that works for most ruckers is to imagine a vertical line connecting the crown of the head to the heel of the rear foot in the stance phase. That line should remain as close to vertical as terrain allows. On uphill sections, a slight forward lean is unavoidable and correct — but it should originate from the ankle, not the hip. The whole body inclines slightly forward together, like a plank rather than a hinge. This engages the glutes as the primary hip extensors and keeps the lumbar spine in its neutral curve rather than flexed under load.

The arm swing deserves attention on long sessions. The natural reciprocal arm swing of walking — right arm forward with left leg, left arm forward with right leg — counterbalances the rotational forces that the leg swing generates at the pelvis. Under a pack, shoulder strap tension can inhibit this swing if the straps are too tight. Keep enough slack that the shoulders can rotate naturally with each step. The rotation is small but its cumulative effect on energy economy over a sixty-minute session is not.

Cadence — steps per minute — has an interesting relationship with ground reaction force under load. Castro and colleagues demonstrated in their 2015 study that higher walking cadences (more steps per minute at the same speed) produce lower vertical ground reaction forces during loaded walking, because each step becomes shorter and lighter. This protective adaptation is one the body naturally recruits at speeds approaching the walk-to-run transition under heavy load. You do not need to artificially increase your cadence, but if you find that a loaded downhill is producing a jarring, heavy footfall, shortening the stride and quickening the cadence is the mechanical solution. Smaller steps, more of them, lighter contact.

::: {.callout-note}
## Quick Data Point
Higher cadence = lower ground reaction force per step. If downhill feels jarring, shorten stride and quicken cadence. Smaller steps, more of them, lighter contact.
:::

The final element of gait form that matters at Phase Three loads is breathing synchronisation. Many experienced ruckers discover spontaneously that their breathing rhythm begins to synchronise with their stride — one inhale over two steps, one exhale over two steps, or variations on that ratio. This locomotive-respiratory coupling is a well-documented phenomenon in running and appears in loaded walking as well. It is not something to force, but something to allow. When the breathing and the stride find each other, the session enters a different register — quieter, more automatic, less effortful. This is not mysticism. It is the nervous system integrating two rhythmic systems into a single coordinated pattern, reducing the attentional cost of managing each separately.

### The Ground Interface: Footwear Under Load

The preceding section established what the foot does during loaded walking. This one addresses what you put on it before you walk out the door — because the biomechanical advantages of correct pack fitting and proper gait form are contingent on the foot-ground interface being correct. If it is not, every benefit documented in the research is diminished at the point where the kinetic chain terminates: the sole of your foot.

Most people will attempt their first ruck in whatever shoes they use for the gym or for casual running. Those shoes are almost certainly wrong for this purpose, and understanding why will make it obvious what right looks like.

**The problem of elevated ground reaction forces.** Earlier chapters documented that load carriage increases ground reaction forces by fifteen to twenty-five percent compared to unloaded walking at the same speed. That force travels up the kinetic chain — from the ground through the foot, ankle, knee, hip, and spine. How the foot receives it determines how well the chain above it can manage it. A shoe that distorts foot mechanics at the base does not merely create a local problem; it creates a compound problem at every joint above.

**Wide toe box.** Under load, the forefoot needs to spread. The five metatarsals are designed to splay outward as the foot accepts body weight, distributing force across the full width of the forefoot rather than concentrating it on individual metatarsal heads. A narrow toe box — the tapered front of most conventional athletic shoes — physically prevents this splay. The toes are compressed together, the metatarsals are held close, and the load that should be distributed across the width of the forefoot instead concentrates on two or three points. The result, at the loads and durations the protocol demands, is elevated stress on individual metatarsal shafts. Metatarsal stress fractures are among the most common load carriage injuries in military populations, and they follow precisely this pattern. The foot needs room to work. If you can press your toes together inside your shoe without the shoe resisting, the toe box is too narrow.

**Zero-drop or low-drop soles.** The Achilles tendon is the largest tendon in the body and one of its most effective energy storage systems. With each heel strike, it stretches and loads elastically; at push-off, it recoils and returns a portion of that energy to the stride. Conventional running shoes carry a heel-to-toe drop of ten to twelve millimetres — the heel is substantially elevated above the forefoot. This elevation shortens the Achilles-calf complex in its resting position, reduces the range over which it can stretch during loading, and shifts force anteriorly onto the knee. Under pack weight, this anterior shift is amplified with every step across a sixty-minute session. A zero-drop sole, or a low-drop sole in the four-to-six-millimetre range, allows the Achilles to work through its full functional range and absorb energy as it is built to do. The caveat is important: if you have spent years in elevated-heel shoes, the Achilles and soleus will have adapted to their shortened position. Transitioning to a zero-drop shoe while simultaneously carrying load is a reliable path to Achilles tendinopathy. Do it gradually — wear zero-drop shoes unloaded for several weeks before using them for rucking, and progress the load no faster than the standard protocol dictates.

**Sole stiffness and ground feel.** A moderately stiff sole offers two things simultaneously: protection against rock bruising on trail surfaces, and enough rigidity to distribute point loads across the full foot rather than allowing a single sharp edge to concentrate force. Maximum-cushion running shoes, however, deaden the proprioceptive feedback that the foot sends to the central nervous system. The foot's mechanoreceptors — its pressure and position sensors — are most accurate when they can feel the actual contour of the ground beneath them. That information drives the real-time micro-adjustments in ankle and knee stability that prevent the cumulative insults that become stress injuries over time. A shoe that muffles this feedback forces the nervous system to operate on degraded data. Look for a sole that protects without insulating. Trail running shoes and boots in the medium-stiffness category generally satisfy this requirement.

**Ankle support.** At loads below approximately fifteen percent of body weight, on moderate terrain, a healthy ankle does not need external support from a boot's upper. The loaded walking itself is training the ankle stabilisers — the peroneals, the tibialis posterior, the intrinsic foot muscles — and external bracing would reduce the training stimulus. Above twenty percent of body weight, or on technical terrain where ankle inversion events are likely, a mid-cut boot or high-cut trail shoe provides a meaningful margin of safety. Military research on load carriage injury supports this threshold: the risk-benefit calculation shifts in favour of external support at higher loads and on uneven ground. If the protocol has you at Phase Three loads on trail terrain, footwear with ankle support is not overcaution — it is appropriate equipment.

**The practical rule.** There is one test that captures all of the above without requiring you to memorise specification numbers. Put your shoes on and try to splay your toes fully inside them. Then check whether your heel is elevated above your forefoot. Then take three steps on a hard floor and notice whether you can feel the ground through the sole. If your toes splay freely, your heel is at or close to the level of your forefoot, and you can feel the texture of the ground beneath you, you are wearing the right shoe for this protocol. If any of those three conditions is absent, the shoe is working against the load, not with it.

## The Deload Protocol

Across a year of rucking, you will encounter two types of accumulated fatigue. The first type is acute: the tiredness that follows a hard session or a week of three sessions. It resolves in twenty-four to forty-eight hours and requires nothing more than the rest days that are already built into the programme's structure. The second type is chronic: the slow accumulation of connective tissue stress, minor joint irritation, and systemic fatigue that occurs when the training load has exceeded the body's capacity for full recovery across multiple consecutive weeks. Chronic fatigue does not announce itself loudly. It presents as sessions that feel harder than they should, as a subtle soreness in the Achilles or the plantar fascia that does not fully resolve overnight, as motivation that dips without apparent cause.

The deload addresses the second type.

Every eighth week — at the end of each two-month block — drop load by approximately thirty percent and reduce weekly session count by one for seven days. If you have been training at twenty kilograms, drop to fourteen. If you have been training at twenty-five kilograms, drop to seventeen or eighteen. Maintain your session duration and pace. The purpose of the deload is not to stop training; it is to reduce the mechanical stimulus enough that the repair processes can run a full cycle before the next loading block begins. Tendons and bone complete their remodelling on timescales of weeks. A single rest day does not allow this; a reduced-load week does.

The subjective experience of a deload week is often counterintuitive. The first session with a reduced pack feels almost too easy — you notice the absence of load. By the third session, you feel fresh in a way that you may not have noticed you had stopped feeling. The session after the deload week, back at full load, feels better than any session in the preceding three weeks. This is the adaptation catching up to the training. This is what you were trying to produce.

The deload is also the right response to any of the following: a joint soreness that has persisted for more than five days; a fatigue that is affecting sleep quality; a period of unusual life stress, illness, or sleep disruption that has impaired recovery. The protocol is not a commitment to a fixed schedule. It is a tool. Use it according to how your body is actually responding, not according to a plan drafted when you felt fresh and ambitious.

## Terrain

The protocol can be completed entirely on flat pavement. For many urban and suburban ruckers, this will be the default surface, and it is entirely adequate for the cardiovascular, metabolic, and osteogenic effects described throughout this book.

Terrain variation, when accessible, adds a dimension that flat surfaces cannot provide. Uphill walking substantially increases the metabolic cost of load carriage — Panizzolo and colleagues documented the metabolic power differential between level and graded terrain at matched loads and speeds. More importantly, uphill walking shifts muscular demand toward the posterior chain — the glutes and hamstrings become the primary hip extensors against gravity — in ways that amplify the functional strength training component of the session. The gluteus maximus, which we have noted is the largest muscle in the human body and disproportionately large compared to any other primate's, is the primary engine of uphill locomotion under load.

Downhill walking is its own challenge. It is not recovery. On descents, the quadriceps are performing eccentric contractions to decelerate the body-plus-pack system against gravity, and eccentric loading is a primary driver of delayed onset muscle soreness, particularly in unaccustomed subjects. In early Phase One, limit prolonged descents. When you do descend with a pack, shorten your stride, keep the knees slightly flexed throughout the stance phase, and resist the temptation to lean back — the instinct is counterproductive, loading the lumbar spine rather than the lower limb musculature where the work should go.

Grass and trail surfaces change the ground contact mechanics in ways that produce additional benefits and additional demands. The absence of a rigid, predictable surface activates ankle and foot stabilisers that flat pavement does not challenge, increasing the functional training effect of each session. The irregular footing also demands more neuromuscular attention, a cognitive engagement with the terrain that most ruckers find mentally restorative in a way that treadmill or track sessions are not.

If you have access to mixed terrain — urban streets with occasional park trails, suburban paths with some topographic variation — incorporate it from Phase Two onward. If your environment is genuinely flat and paved, the protocol delivers its full effect regardless.

## What a Session Looks Like

Walk out your front door. The pack is loaded and fitted. Your mouth is closed.

The first five minutes of every session are not a warm-up in the traditional sense — you are not stretching or performing mobility drills. You are simply beginning to walk at a deliberate pace, allowing the body to come to its working temperature, allowing the gait pattern to find itself under load. There is no need to rush this phase. The first five minutes of a ruck are the biological equivalent of allowing an engine to come to operating temperature before putting it under load: the synovial fluid in the hip, knee, and ankle joints distributes more evenly, the intervertebral discs equilibrate under the new axial load, the posterior chain musculature arrives at the activation levels it will sustain for the remainder of the session.

From five minutes onward, you should be at your working pace. Check your breathing. It should be nasal, rhythmic, and controlled. Check your posture. The crown of the head should be reaching toward the sky. The shoulders should be relaxed, not hunched, with the pack sitting high on the thoracic spine rather than dragging down into the lumbar curve. The hip belt should be bearing a noticeable fraction of the load — you will feel the difference immediately if it has loosened during the first few minutes of walking, as the weight shifts back onto the shoulders.

Walk.

The sessions in Phase One and early Phase Two are thirty to forty-five minutes. Walk continuously. Do not stop to check your phone. The cardiovascular adaptation you are training is a sustained aerobic effort, and stopping for two minutes every ten breaks the metabolic signal you are trying to deliver. If you need water, drink from a hydration bladder inside the pack. If you need to cross a street, keep walking in place. This sounds obsessive, and in the context of Phase Three sessions approaching ninety minutes it is perfectly normal to take a brief rest. In the early phases, the sessions are short enough that continuous movement serves the adaptation better than intermittent effort.

At the end of the session, do not stop abruptly. Walk the final five minutes at a slightly reduced pace, allowing heart rate to come down and the posterior chain to transition from loaded work to recovery. Then remove the pack. The act of removing it after an hour under load produces a physiological effect that every rucker recognises: the body feels momentarily lighter than its actual mass, as though gravity has been briefly suspended. This is the central nervous system recalibrating its expectation of gravitational force. Enjoy the sensation. It is evidence that the session did what it was supposed to do.

## The Full Rucking Prescription

**Phase One — Weeks 1 to 4**
Load: ten to fifteen percent of body weight.
Duration: thirty to forty-five minutes.
Frequency: two sessions per week.
Gate: nasal breathing comfortable throughout.
Intensity: RPE eleven to thirteen, HR sixty to seventy percent of maximum.

**Phase Two — Weeks 5 to 12**
Load: eighteen to twenty-two percent of body weight.
Duration: forty-five to sixty minutes.
Frequency: three sessions per week.
Progression: add two kilograms every two weeks (males) or three weeks (females) if nasal gate is met.
Gate: nasal breathing comfortable throughout.
Intensity: RPE eleven to fourteen, HR sixty to seventy-five percent of maximum.

**Phase Three — Months 4 to 6**
Load: twenty-five to thirty percent of body weight.
Duration: sixty to ninety minutes.
Frequency: three to four sessions per week.
Speed target: working toward one-point-five metres per second (five-point-four kilometres per hour) on flat terrain.
Gate: nasal breathing comfortable throughout.
Intensity: RPE eleven to fourteen, HR sixty to seventy-five percent of maximum, blood lactate below two millimoles per litre if measurable.

**Deload: Every eighth week**
Load: reduce by thirty percent.
Frequency: reduce by one session.
Duration: maintain.
Purpose: allow connective tissue remodelling to complete a full cycle.

**The load progression gate**
If nasal breathing is not comfortable at the new load, return to the previous load for one additional block before re-attempting the increase.

That is the entire prescription. You do not need to add anything to it. You do not need to periodise it in any more complex way. You do not need a heart rate variability app to tell you when to deload — your Achilles tendon will tell you. You do not need a coach to verify your form — your nasal gate will verify your intensity. You do not need a gym.

You need a backpack, something heavy, and your nose.

## What You Are Actually Doing

Let us be precise about what the protocol is building, because precision makes commitment easier.

In weeks one through four, you are training connective tissue. The tendons of the posterior chain — Achilles, patellar, hamstring origins — are beginning the remodelling process that will allow them to sustain heavier loads without accumulating microdamage. The bone of your calcaneus, metatarsals, tibia, and femoral neck is responding to the axial loading with the osteogenic signal that increases mineral deposition. None of this is visible. None of it feels like much.

In weeks five through twelve, you are training the cardiovascular system. Three sessions per week at twenty percent of body weight and forty-five to sixty minutes each produce a Zone 2 aerobic stimulus that the heart, vasculature, and mitochondria of your skeletal muscle respond to with the same adaptations that structured endurance training has always produced: increased stroke volume, reduced resting heart rate, proliferation of mitochondria in slow-twitch and fast-twitch oxidative fibres, improved fat oxidation at matched absolute workloads. You are also training the posterior chain as a functional unit — erectors, glutes, hamstrings — in a way that the gym cannot replicate, because you are doing it over terrain and time rather than in a fixed range of motion for a fixed number of repetitions.

In months four through six, you are training bone at the doses that exercise physiologists have identified as sufficient for bone formation rather than merely bone maintenance. Santos and colleagues documented the dynamic joint stiffening that accompanies Phase Three loads: the ankle and knee joints increase their resistance to deformation under load (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001 respectively), adapting structurally to the mechanical environment you have given them. Panizzolo's metabolic power data confirm that you are now producing cardiovascular training effects comparable to jogging, at impact forces that remain characteristic of walking gait — without the injury rates that accumulate when walking-speed physiology is pursued at running-speed mechanics.

And through all three phases, with every session, you are doing one other thing that is harder to quantify but is perhaps the most important thing: you are maintaining the competence. The ability to cover ground under load, to breathe efficiently while doing it, to tolerate sustained discomfort without distress — this is a physical capacity that has historically been a proxy for the ability to function in the world at the level at which we evolved to function in it. Studenski and colleagues demonstrated that gait speed in older adults predicts survival with the accuracy of complex clinical models. What rucking does across years and decades is keep that speed, that competence, that functional capacity alive. You do not ruck to prepare for something. You ruck because this is the preparation.

## The First Session

You have read enough. Now here is what you actually do tomorrow morning.

Weigh yourself. Calculate ten percent of that number in kilograms. Round down if it lands between kilogram increments. Load the pack with that weight, positioned high and close to your back. Cinch the hip belt over your iliac crest. Snug the shoulder straps until the pack rides against your thoracic spine. Close your mouth.

Walk for thirty minutes.

That is the first session. Nothing more is required. The thirty minutes will feel different from any thirty minutes of exercise you have experienced before, because the stimulus is different — diffuse, whole-body, ancestral. Your posterior chain will be working. Your cardiovascular system will be operating in its optimal training zone. Your nose will be doing what it was built to do. Your spine will be under axial load for the first time in a context that its architecture was designed to handle.

When you return home and remove the pack, notice the sensation of lightness. Notice that the thirty minutes passed in a way that feels qualitatively different from time spent on a stationary machine — more like time doing something than time enduring something.

That is the programme. That is the pack on your back.

It fits in a bag you already own, or one that costs less than a month's gym membership. It works on every surface your feet can reach. It asks nothing of you except consistency and a closed mouth.

Three and a half million years of primate evolution loaded this pack. The least you can do is carry it.
