# What We Don't Know {#sec-evidence-gaps}

There is a particular kind of dishonesty that operates under the cover of enthusiasm. It appears in popular science books that present convergent hypotheses as established facts, in fitness protocols that cite a handful of studies as if they foreclosed all further inquiry, in health journalism that smooths over the distinction between what a trial demonstrated in a specific population and what that demonstration implies for the person reading the article on their phone. It is the dishonesty of the advocate who has decided the conclusion first and selected the evidence to support it. It is not lying, exactly. It is something more insidious than lying: it is the strategic presentation of partial truth as complete understanding.

This chapter is an attempt to do the opposite.

Every claim in this book that is stated with confidence is stated with confidence because the underlying evidence warrants it. But a significant portion of this book's argument rests on evidence that is indirect, inferential, or drawn from adjacent populations and then extrapolated to the populations most likely to be reading these pages. That extrapolation is not dishonest---it is, in fact, the ordinary practice of applied science, which must always operate somewhat ahead of the specific evidence---but it imposes an obligation. The obligation is to tell you, clearly and without embarrassment, exactly where the direct evidence ends and the inference begins. Not in a footnote. Not in an appendix. In a chapter of its own, because the gap between what we know and what we are building on matters, and pretending it does not exist is a form of the dishonesty described above.

What follows is a structured account of the seven most significant evidence gaps in the scientific foundation of this protocol. The goal is not to undermine the preceding chapters. The goal is to give you a precise understanding of which arguments rest on firm experimental ground and which rest on the kind of convergent indirect evidence that is intellectually defensible but not yet experimentally confirmed. If you understand the difference, you are in a better position to evaluate the protocol for yourself---and to follow, in the coming years, the research that will eventually fill these gaps.

## The Hormonal Argument: Coherent but Not Yet Directly Tested

Chapter Six made a case about testosterone and cortisol. The case was this: high-volume running chronically suppresses testosterone via the Exercise-Hypogonadal Male Condition, while the resistance-type loading characteristics of rucking---specifically, the sustained axial load that recruits the posterior chain in a pattern biomechanically similar to loaded carries---are more likely to maintain a favorable anabolic-to-catabolic hormonal ratio. The argument was grounded in Hooper et al.'s 2016 EHMC documentation, in Gaviglio et al.'s demonstration that farmer's walk variants produce acute testosterone elevation, in Taylor et al.'s finding that military men whose occupational demands include regular load carriage maintain anabolic hormone profiles comparable to recreational weightlifters. It is a strong argument. The convergent direction of the evidence is consistent.

But no published randomized controlled trial has directly compared serum testosterone and cortisol between rucking and high-volume running in a controlled crossover design.

This is not a minor caveat. It is the central evidentiary fact about the hormonal claims in this book. The ideal study would recruit a cohort of men matched for age, baseline testosterone, training history, and body composition, randomize them to a rucking program versus a running program matched for duration and energy expenditure, and measure not a single morning testosterone draw but a dense sampling protocol---the kind Hooper's team used, drawing blood every fifteen minutes across a four-hour window---at baseline, mid-intervention, and conclusion. No such study exists. What exists is the inferential architecture: the EHMC data establishes that high-volume running suppresses testosterone; the resistance exercise literature establishes that loaded carries tend to elevate it; the military occupational load carriage data suggests that men who ruck regularly as part of their work maintain favorable hormonal profiles. From these three bodies of evidence, the inference that rucking is hormonally superior to running is reasonable. But it has not been tested directly, and the difference between reasonable inference and experimental confirmation is the difference between a hypothesis and a finding.

The honest position, then, is this: the hormonal argument is the most compelling indirect case in this book, and it remains an indirect case. It should inform your decision-making about exercise selection with the weight appropriate to convergent inferential evidence, not the weight appropriate to a randomized controlled trial. Those are different things.

## The Spine: A Mechanistic Argument Without Imaging Evidence

Chapter Nine described rucking's axial loading profile as a form of cyclical spinal stimulus---the alternating compression and decompression of walking gait, amplified by the addition of external load, driving the fluid exchange and nutrient diffusion that maintains intervertebral disc hydration across decades. This is mechanistically coherent. The intervertebral disc is avascular. It depends on the pumping action of cyclic loading and unloading for nutrient transport into the nucleus pulposus. Prolonged static compression expresses fluid from the disc. Dynamic cyclic loading of the kind that walking produces promotes the alternating pressure gradients that draw fluid and dissolved nutrients back in. The addition of moderate axial load from a rucksack amplifies this mechanical effect without---at sensible loads---producing the pathological overloading documented in Marines carrying sixty percent of their body weight across extended deployments.

The problem is that none of this has been confirmed by imaging.

No T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging study and no T1 rho mapping study---the two modalities that can quantify disc hydration in vivo---has measured intervertebral disc water content before and after loaded walking at any intensity. Not at ten percent of body weight. Not at twenty. Not in a healthy population, and not in a clinical one. The spinal health argument in this protocol is mechanistic inference from first principles of disc physiology and general load carriage biomechanics. It is not evidence that rucking improves disc hydration. It is an argument that the mechanical characteristics of rucking are the kind that, based on what we understand about disc biology, should promote disc health rather than impair it---and that the catastrophic loading levels documented in military populations are substantially above the loads recommended here.

Onodera et al.'s 2019 MRI study of active-duty Marines showed disc height reductions under operationally relevant loads, but those loads---often exceeding forty-five kilograms---were not the loads this protocol recommends, and the study measured disc kinematics under acute loading rather than disc hydration over time. The existing imaging literature establishes the outer bounds of harmful loading; it does not characterize the beneficial zone within which this protocol operates.

Until someone runs a longitudinal disc hydration imaging study in a non-military rucking population---measuring T2 signal before and after sessions, and across months of regular practice---the spinal health argument remains mechanistic. Well-grounded mechanistically. Unconfirmed experimentally.

## The Missing Population: Women Between Forty and Seventy

This is arguably the most consequential gap in the entire literature, for a reason that is not primarily about evidence quality but about who needs this intervention most.

The biomechanical load carriage literature that underpins this book is overwhelmingly derived from young, predominantly male, military populations. Walsh and Low's 2021 systematic review of military load carriage effects on gait---the single most comprehensive synthesis of the relevant biomechanics literature---synthesized studies in which participants were characteristically between twenty and thirty-one years old, predominantly or entirely male, and selected for physical fitness levels well above civilian norms. Johnson et al.'s 2024 study, which is the most methodologically rigorous sex-comparative biomechanical dataset available, examined U.S. Army Basic Combat Training recruits---fit young adults at the beginning of military careers, not women in their fifties managing declining bone density, shifting hormonal environments, altered pelvic floor mechanics, and the early stages of dynapenic muscle loss that will determine whether they remain functionally independent in their eighties.

The argument for rucking in women between forty and seventy is built on the bones of this military biomechanical data and then extrapolated through adjacent literatures: the postmenopausal bone density research, the pelvic floor physiology, the female-specific RED-S considerations that Chapter Seven addressed. But the direct data---force plate studies, tibial acceleration measurements, spine loading measurements, pelvic floor pressure measurements during loaded walking---for this age group, in this sex, at the loads this protocol recommends, does not exist in anything approaching adequate form. Gait mechanics change after forty. Bone geometry changes. The pelvic floor's ability to generate and sustain intra-abdominal pressure changes with parity history and hormonal status in ways that have direct implications for both injury risk and the core stabilization benefits that Chapter Eight attributed to nasal-diaphragmatic breathing under load.

The population that most needs the osteogenic and anabolic benefits of weighted walking is precisely the population for which the direct biomechanical data is most sparse. This should be stated plainly, and it should motivate the practical conservatism that runs through the load prescription in Part III: the recommendation to start at five to eight percent of body weight, to progress slowly, to monitor symptoms, is not excessive caution. It is the appropriate response to operating in an evidence gap.

## Dynapenia and Older Men: Dose-Response Data We Don't Have

The argument for rucking as a dynapenia countermeasure in men over sixty-five was made in Chapter Twelve, and it rests on a genuine and urgent biological reality. Muscle strength---not muscle mass, but the neuromuscular capacity to generate force rapidly and reliably---begins declining in the fifth decade and accelerates through the seventh and eighth. The functional independence threshold---the ability to rise from a chair unassisted, to climb stairs, to arrest a fall, to carry groceries---depends on strength preservation in ways that are increasingly well-characterized in the gerontological literature. Kraemer et al.'s foundational resistance training endocrinology work, even conducted in sixty-two-year-old men, established that periodized mechanical loading stimulates meaningful hormonal and neuromuscular adaptation into the seventh decade. The general case for loaded mechanical stimulus in older men is sound.

What does not exist is a randomized controlled trial specifically examining the minimum effective dose of loaded walking for dynapenia prevention in men over sixty-five.

The clinical question is precise: how much load, at what frequency, for how long, is necessary to produce measurable preservation of grip strength, isokinetic knee extension torque, and functional movement capacity in older men---with the specific outcome of delaying the functional independence threshold? The existing weighted vest studies in older populations are predominantly focused on women, and their primary outcomes are typically bone density and fall prevention rather than strength preservation and sarcopenia resistance. Lowe et al.'s 2025 HRV study during simulated military operations involved physically active males in their late twenties and thirties, not men navigating the compound challenges of late-life hormonal decline, decreased motor unit recruitment capacity, and the recovery limitations that follow from reduced growth hormone pulsatility.

The dose-response question in this specific population is genuinely unanswered. The protocol's recommendation of two to three sessions per week at fifteen to twenty percent of body weight for men over sixty-five is grounded in the resistance training periodization principles that Kraemer's work established, in the military load carriage fatigue literature, in the general exercise gerontology framework. But the specific claim that this particular dose produces measurable dynapenia protection in this particular population has not been tested in an RCT. A dose-response study examining five, ten, fifteen, and twenty percent of body weight at two versus three sessions per week, with primary outcomes of grip dynamometry, five-times sit-to-stand performance, and six-minute walk test, would be among the most valuable clinical research investments in exercise gerontology. It has not been done.

## Nasal Breathing During Load Carriage: The Protocol's Untested Element

Chapter Eight made a detailed physiological case for nasal-only breathing during rucking. The case assembled four lines of evidence: paranasal sinus nitric oxide production and its pulmonary vasodilatory effects; autonomic regulation through the parasympathetic dominance that nasal airway resistance promotes; ventilatory efficiency improvements documented in cycling and clinical exercise testing; and the diaphragmatic recruitment cascade that generates intra-abdominal pressure and, in turn, lumbar stabilization under load. The evidence in each of these domains is real. Lundberg et al.'s foundational work on sinus nitric oxide has been replicated. Deus et al.'s 2024 demonstration of parasympathetic HRV shift with nasal breathing is methodologically clean. Eser et al.'s 2024 ventilatory efficiency data---showing VE/VCO2 reductions that, in heart failure patients, matched months of high-intensity interval training---is striking. Trevisan et al.'s electromyographic evidence that nasal breathers recruit the diaphragm more effectively than mouth breathers is consistent with what the respiratory physiology predicts.

But no published study has directly examined nasal-only breathing during loaded walking at any intensity.

The entire Akureyri Protocol nasal breathing component is, in technical terms, a mechanistic inference applied to a movement modality in which it has never been directly tested. Rappelt et al.'s 2023 nasal breathing study used low-intensity cycling. Eser et al.'s 2024 data came from seated exercise testing on a cycle ergometer with heart failure patients. The WKU 2024 walking study that found significant RER differences between breathing modes used five-minute steady-state bouts, not sixty-minute rucking sessions, and the sample of thirty-three participants represents modest statistical power. None of these studies involved a backpack. None measured the specific interaction between thoracic load distribution, spinal stabilization demands, respiratory mechanics under axial compression, and the diaphragmatic function that nasal breathing is supposed to enhance.

It is physiologically plausible, perhaps likely, that the nasal breathing benefits documented in cycling and clinical exercise settings transfer to loaded walking. The mechanistic chain is coherent: the nitric oxide pathway is mode-independent, the autonomic effects of nasal airway resistance are mode-independent, and the IAP-generating function of forced diaphragmatic recruitment would be, if anything, more relevant under axial load than without it. But plausible and demonstrated are different categories, and the claim that nasal breathing during rucking specifically produces the suite of benefits described in Chapter Eight requires direct experimental validation that does not yet exist.

The practical implication for this protocol is modest, because the nasal breathing recommendation rests on a foundation that is mechanistically coherent and unlikely to be wrong. But the intellectual honesty implication is significant: you should know that the Akureyri Protocol's most distinctive feature---the closed-mouth rule---is the protocol's most experimentally uncharted territory.

## Fat Oxidation: Where the Evidence Contradicts Itself

The metabolic substrate argument---that rucking, performed in Zone 2 with nasal breathing as an intensity governor, produces superior fat oxidation relative to higher-intensity aerobic exercise---is supported by evidence that is genuinely mixed, and the mixing deserves more than a footnote.

The Western Kentucky University 2024 study found a statistically significant respiratory exchange ratio difference between nasal and oral breathing during steady-state walking: nasal breathing produced a lower RER, indicating a greater proportion of fat oxidation (F(1,32) = 44.479, p < 0.001). That is a strong result with a large F-statistic, from a study that used walking rather than cycling, and the direction of the effect is exactly what the Akureyri Protocol predicts. The mechanistic interpretation offered in Chapter Eight---that nasal breathing enforces an intensity ceiling that keeps the exerciser in the fat-oxidation-dominant zone---is consistent with this finding.

But Rappelt et al.'s 2023 study, conducted over sixty minutes of self-selected low-intensity cycling with nasal-only versus oronasal breathing, found no significant RER difference between conditions (p = 0.67, partial eta squared = 0.01). That is an emphatically null result. Eser et al.'s 2024 study, using heart failure patients and healthy controls on cycle ergometers, similarly found no RER difference between breathing modes in any group. Bergqvist et al.'s 2025 study in twelve well-trained male cyclists found no significant RER difference across oral, oronasal, and decongested oronasal breathing conditions (p = 0.06 for the trial main effect, which narrowly fails conventional significance thresholds but does not support a strong positive claim).

There is a possible reconciliation. The WKU study used walking; the null-result studies used cycling. The metabolic substrate profile of walking may differ from cycling in ways that make nasal breathing's intensity-governing function more consequential during ambulatory locomotion. Alternatively, the effect may be real but more modest and less consistent than a single study with thirty-three participants can reliably characterize. The walking-specific evidence is currently the most directly relevant to this protocol, and it supports the argument. But it would be misleading to present that support without acknowledging that the broader nasal breathing and substrate utilization literature does not consistently find the same effect, and that the preponderance of the exercise physiology RCT evidence on this question is currently null.

The conservative reading is that nasal breathing's primary metabolic contribution to this protocol is the intensity governance mechanism---keeping the exerciser in a zone where fat is the dominant fuel by making higher intensities physiologically untenable through ventilatory constraint---rather than a direct pharmacological-style shift in substrate preference at any given intensity. That is a meaningful contribution, and it is well-supported. The stronger claim---that nasal breathing independently shifts the fat-carbohydrate oxidation ratio at matched intensities---is supported by one walking-specific study and contradicted by several cycling studies, and should be held proportionally.

## Cardiovascular Adaptation in Older Ruckers: The Youngest Dataset

Chapter Twelve's cardiovascular argument drew heavily on Lowe et al.'s 2025 study of heart rate variability during simulated military operations involving daily load carriage at approximately thirty percent of body weight. The study is methodologically rigorous by military exercise science standards: thirty-two participants, twenty days of structured operations cycles alternating low-stress and high-stress phases, dense HRV measurement. The findings are meaningful: short-term exercise HRV metrics---SDNN, RMSSD, LF, and HF power---all increased from the first to the last day of both stress cycles, suggesting progressive parasympathetic adaptation to the chronic load carriage stimulus. This is exactly the cardiovascular signature associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk in the epidemiological literature.

The participants were thirty-two physically active males in their late twenties and early thirties.

No randomized controlled trial has measured chronic cardiovascular adaptations---VO2max changes, arterial stiffness, left ventricular geometry, carotid intima-media thickness progression---specifically from a loaded walking program in men or women over fifty. The HRV data from Lowe et al. is the best available direct evidence that rucking produces parasympathetic cardiovascular adaptation. It is derived from a population that is approximately twenty to twenty-five years younger than the population to whom this protocol is primarily addressed, selected for above-average fitness, and operating under the specific physiological conditions of a military simulation rather than the everyday conditions of a recreational rucking practice. The extrapolation from young military males to older civilians is supported by the general exercise adaptation literature---cardiovascular training principles do not suddenly stop operating at fifty---but has not been directly confirmed for this movement modality in this age group.

The absence of this evidence is particularly consequential because the cardiovascular risk profile of older adults is qualitatively different from that of young military men. Arterial stiffness, impaired baroreceptor sensitivity, blunted heart rate recovery, and reduced cardiac autonomic modulation are characteristic features of aging that intersect with rucking's specific hemodynamic demands---particularly the blood pressure response to sustained load carriage with a hip belt that transfers compressive force through the iliac vessels---in ways that have not been systematically characterized. The recommendation in Chapter Twelve that men and women over sixty begin with lighter loads and shorter duration, and that those with established cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled hypertension consult a physician before beginning, is not merely legal caution. It is the practical acknowledgment that the evidence base for cardiovascular safety and efficacy in this specific population has a gap large enough to warrant behavioral conservatism.

## What Indirect Evidence Actually Means

The preceding sections document seven gaps. A critic of this protocol could read them and conclude that the scientific foundation is insufficient---that you should not start a rucking practice, or trust the hormonal argument, or follow the nasal breathing instruction, until every gap has been filled. That conclusion would be both logically wrong and practically harmful.

Evidence-based medicine has never been evidence-complete medicine. Every clinical decision made in the absence of a perfect randomized controlled trial---and the overwhelming majority of clinical decisions are made in exactly that absence---relies on convergent indirect inference, mechanistic coherence, population extrapolation, and the accumulated judgment of practitioners who have observed more than the trials have yet quantified. The question is not whether uncertainty exists. Uncertainty always exists. The question is whether the inference is reasonable given the evidence that does exist, and whether it is honestly presented.

The hormonal argument in this book is not speculation. It is a specific, directional, convergent inference from three bodies of evidence that independently point toward the same conclusion. Each body of evidence has been accumulated by researchers who were not studying rucking, using populations that were not recreational middle-aged ruckers, and arriving at mechanistic findings that, taken together, constitute a coherent case. The absence of a direct rucking-versus-running testosterone RCT does not mean the inference is unfounded. It means the inference has not yet been directly tested---which is a different thing.

The spinal argument is mechanistic inference from disc physiology. The mechanistic inference is coherent. The disc hydration mechanism is established. The cycling of compression and decompression during walking is established. The question of whether adding a rucksack amplifies this beneficially or moves the loading into a range that impairs it has not been answered by imaging, but the load parameters recommended in this protocol---five to twenty percent of body weight---are substantially below the ranges associated with documented disc height reduction in military imaging studies. The gap is real; the inference is not reckless.

The nasal breathing evidence is the most directly mechanistic of all the gaps: the physiological pathways invoked are well-established in other exercise contexts, and the question of whether they transfer to loaded walking is a test of context specificity, not a test of whether the pathways exist. The pathways exist. Context specificity is a legitimate scientific question, but it is a question that is generally answered yes when the fundamental physiology is mode-independent.

What convergent evidence means, as a matter of epistemology, is that multiple independent lines of inquiry are pointing in the same direction without having been designed to converge. No single study was trying to make the case for rucking's hormonal superiority to running. The EHMC researchers were trying to understand testosterone suppression in athletes. The resistance training endocrinologists were trying to understand anabolic adaptation. The military occupational physiologists were trying to understand load carriage performance. When findings from these unrelated projects converge on a consistent directional inference, that convergence is itself evidence---weaker than a direct test, but not nothing.

## The Research Agenda

These gaps are not embarrassments. They are a research agenda.

The hormonal gap requires a crossover RCT: matched men, rucking versus running at matched energy expenditure, dense blood sampling across a morning hormonal window, at baseline and after eight and sixteen weeks. This study is feasible. It requires a sports physiology laboratory with the willingness to conduct seventeen blood draws per subject per session. The cost is real but not prohibitive. The value to the field would be substantial.

The disc hydration gap requires a T2 or T1 rho MRI protocol designed for repeated measurement: participants scanned before and after a sixty-minute rucking session at fifteen percent of body weight, then again the following morning after overnight recovery, with comparison to both unloaded walking and rest conditions. This study would be methodologically straightforward for any sports medicine radiology unit with an interest in exercise physiology. That it has not been done reflects the relative neglect of civilian rucking as a research topic, not any technical barrier.

The women forty-to-seventy gap requires biomechanical studies that nobody has prioritized because the military, which funds most load carriage research, has limited institutional interest in the exercise physiology of postmenopausal civilians. This is the most politically tractable gap to close: public health funding agencies interested in fall prevention, osteoporosis management, and functional independence in aging women should be actively funding this research, because the epidemiology of the population that needs it most is precisely the population that has been most systematically excluded from the biomechanical data.

The nasal breathing during rucking gap requires a simple crossover protocol: the same session, nasal-only versus oronasal breathing, measuring RER, PETCO2, blood lactate, HRV, and if possible IAP through intravesical pressure or ultrasound-measured diaphragmatic excursion, during sixty minutes of loaded walking at a standardized speed and load. This is a graduate-level exercise physiology project. It would resolve, in a single well-designed study, the most directly testable uncertainty in this entire protocol.

The older men cardiovascular gap requires what the cardiovascular rehabilitation community already knows how to do---twelve to twenty-four week exercise interventions with pre-post VO2max, pulse wave velocity, and echocardiographic assessment---but applied to loaded walking rather than cycle ergometry or treadmill running.

These studies need to be done. The people who will do them are reading exercise physiology journals and supervising graduate students at universities where the equipment exists and the expertise is available. If this book reaches any of them: here is your research agenda.

## Why This Chapter Earns Your Trust

There is a paradox operating in this chapter that deserves to be named directly.

By telling you where the evidence is weakest, this book is asking you to trust the evidence more, not less. The mechanism is straightforward. An author who presents only confident claims gives you no basis for calibrating which claims to hold firmly and which to hold tentatively. An author who distinguishes between a direct RCT finding and a convergent inferential argument gives you a precision instrument: you can weight the evidence appropriately, remain appropriately skeptical of the inferential claims, and return to them when the direct evidence eventually arrives. The former author is more persuasive in the short term. The latter author is more useful over time.

Every fitness protocol ever written has evidence gaps. The ones that do not disclose them are not operating from stronger evidence---they are operating from less intellectual honesty. The protocol in this book rests on what it rests on, and what it rests on has been described with the most technical specificity available. Where it is strong, it is strong. Where it is indirect, it has been labeled as indirect. Where it extrapolates from one population to another, the extrapolation has been named.

The practical conservatism embedded in this protocol---the graduated load increases, the emphasis on symptom monitoring, the physician consultation recommendation for older adults and those with cardiovascular histories, the instruction to stop if spinal symptoms emerge and evaluate load before progressing---is not the product of legal caution. It is the product of the gaps described in this chapter. If the disc hydration evidence were direct and robust, the load prescription could be stated with more specificity. If the biomechanical data for women over fifty existed at the resolution it exists for young male soldiers, the female protocol could be more precisely calibrated. In the absence of that data, the responsible position is the conservative one: start with less than you think you need, progress more slowly than you think necessary, and let the absence of symptoms guide the upward adjustments.

The evidence gaps are not a reason to distrust this protocol. They are the reason the protocol is designed the way it is.

---

You are now in possession of the complete picture. Not just the evidence that supports the argument, but the shape of the argument's limits---where the ground beneath it is firm and where it is provisional, where you are standing on direct experimental confirmation and where you are standing on the kind of careful inference that science deploys while it waits for the experiments that will eventually either confirm or correct it. That kind of transparency is what an honest book owes its reader.

The man on the trail above Akureyri with a pack on his back and his mouth closed is not waiting for the RCT. He has been at this for years. His spine does not hurt. His sleep is good. His legs carry him further than they did a decade ago. The functional measures---the chair stands, the stair climbs, the absence of the injuries that accumulate in the medical records of his running peers---speak in the language that precedes controlled trials, which is the language of persistent embodied experience across time.

That language is not science. But science, at its best, is a formalization of the questions that embodied experience generates. The questions are good ones. The experiments are coming.

In the meantime, put on the pack.
