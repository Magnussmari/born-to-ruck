## Evidence Foundation

This protocol is built on five converging lines of evidence:

1. **Evolutionary biomechanics.** Homo sapiens is a specialised load-carrier. Bipedalism co-selected with long-distance weighted travel (Carvalho et al. 2012; Bramble & Lieberman 2004). Torso-centred backpack loading is the most metabolically efficient carrying method in any primate (Wall-Scheffler 2007).

2. **Osteogenic loading.** The osteogenic threshold during walking requires approximately 25--30% bodyweight load at $\geq$1.5 m/s, producing ~1.4--1.7$\times$ BW ground reaction force. Unloaded walking (~1.0--1.5$\times$ BW GRF) falls below this threshold; running (~2.0--2.9$\times$ BW GRF) exceeds it with an injurious impact transient (Nilsson & Thorstensson 1989; Sánchez-Trigo et al. 2022).

3. **Hormonal preservation.** Men running >81 km/week show chronically suppressed testosterone versus sedentary controls at all time points (Hooper et al. 2017; p $\leq$ 0.05)---the Exercise-Hypogonadal Male Condition. Rucking as a Zone 2/resistance hybrid avoids the training volume threshold that triggers EHMC. Farmer's walks produce significant acute testosterone elevation (p < 0.01; Gaviglio et al. 2015). Elite military men under regular load carriage maintain testosterone profiles comparable to recreational weightlifters (Taylor et al. 2016).

4. **Biomechanical completeness.** The five-movement system covers all three planes of motion, diurnal spinal compression/decompression, grip endurance, scapular health, and full hip/knee/ankle ROM. Chronic load carriage training (30% BW, 20 days) increases paraspinal muscle CSA from 9126 $\pm$ 692 mm² to 9863 $\pm$ 456 mm² and produces measurable parasympathetic cardiovascular adaptation (Qu et al. 2020; Lowe et al. 2025).

5. **Nasal breathing as intensity regulator.** At submaximal rucking intensities, nasal-only breathing reduces minute ventilation by ~22%, lowers VE/VCO₂ from 28.6 to 25.8 (Calamai et al. 2024; p $\leq$ 0.01), reduces blood lactate from 1.45 to 1.21 mmol/L (Rappelt et al. 2023; p = 0.02), and delivers paranasal sinus NO (300--30,000 ppb) to the pulmonary vasculature.

## The Five Movements

| Movement | Primary Stimulus | Plane | Frequency |
|----------|-----------------|-------|-----------|
| **Rucking** | Zone 2 cardio + osteogenic loading + posterior chain | Sagittal | 3--4$\times$/week |
| **Farmer carries** | Frontal-plane loading, grip, core stability, T/C ratio | Frontal + sagittal | 2$\times$/week |
| **Dead hangs** | Traction decompression, grip strength, shoulder health | Vertical | Daily |
| **Push-ups** | Anterior chain, scapular protraction counterbalance | Sagittal | Daily |
| **Deep squat** | Full hip/knee/ankle ROM, synovial distribution | All three | Daily |

## The Akureyri Protocol: Nasal Breathing Rules

Apply throughout all rucking sessions:

::: {.callout-important}
## The Rule
Nasal inhalation and exhalation only. Mouth never opens. If you cannot maintain nasal breathing, slow pace or reduce load until you can. This is not optional---it is the intensity regulator.
:::

**Adaptation timeline:** Non-adapted individuals lose ~10% VO₂max during nasal restriction. This disappears after $\geq$6 months of consistent practice (Dallam 2018). Expect 4--8 weeks of discomfort before steady state feels natural.

**Humming on exhale** (optional): Increases nasal sinus NO output ~15-fold (Weitzberg & Lundberg 2002)---beneficial during warm-up walks.

**Progression gate:** Only increase load or pace when you can complete the full session without breaking nasal breathing.

### Nasal Breathing Evidence Summary

| Parameter | Nasal | Oral/Oronasal | Result | Source |
|-----------|-------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Paranasal sinus NO | 300--30,000 ppb | Bypassed (0) | --- | Lundberg et al. |
| HF-HRV (%) | 59 $\pm$ 19 | 52 $\pm$ 21 | d = 0.50, p = 0.04 | Deus et al. 2024 |
| LF/HF ratio | 0.9 $\pm$ 0.8 | 1.2 $\pm$ 0.9 | d = 0.49, p = 0.04 | Deus et al. 2024 |
| Diastolic BP (mmHg) | 68 | 72 | r = 0.89, p < 0.001 | Deus et al. 2024 |
| PETCO₂ (mmHg) | 43.5 | 41.5 | p < 0.001, ηp² = 0.46 | Rappelt et al. 2023 |
| VE/VCO₂ | 25.8 | 28.6 | p $\leq$ 0.01 | Calamai et al. 2024 |
| Blood lactate T60 (mmol/L) | 1.21 $\pm$ 0.47 | 1.45 $\pm$ 0.52 | SMD = 0.48, p = 0.02 | Rappelt et al. 2023 |
| HR post-exercise, males (bpm) | 123.2 $\pm$ 15.8 | 127.7 $\pm$ 16.9 | d = 0.32, p = 0.033 | Lörinczi et al. 2024 |
| Cortisol reduction | --30.29% | baseline | p < 0.05 | Obaya et al. 2023 |
| SpO₂ during exercise | ~98% | ~98% | ns | Lörinczi et al. 2024 |

: Akureyri Protocol evidence table {#tbl-nasal-evidence}

::: {.callout-note}
The blood lactate and VE/VCO₂ effects are the most robust. RER fat-oxidation shift is present in walking-specific research but not consistently replicated in cycling. Nasal breathing's primary metabolic value during rucking is as an intensity governor that prevents Zone 3 drift.

## Plan A: Male Protocol (41-Year-Old Anchor)

### Physiological Context

A 41-year-old male is in early andropause-adjacent decline: testosterone decreases approximately 1--2% per year from age 30. The central risk is EHMC: men running >81 km/week show chronic testosterone suppression at all time points (Hooper et al. 2017). High-volume chronic endurance training is specifically contraindicated for hormonal longevity.

**Primary goals:**

1. Preserve testosterone/cortisol ratio---avoid EHMC trigger volume
2. Achieve and maintain osteogenic loading threshold
3. Maintain diurnal spinal decompression
4. Build Zone 2 cardiovascular base without inflammatory cortisol load
5. Sustain grip and posterior chain strength

### Weekly Structure

```
MON   Ruck (Zone 2, nasal, 45–60 min)
TUE   Farmer carries + Dead hangs + Push-ups + Deep squat
WED   Rest or light walk (no load)
THU   Ruck (Zone 2, nasal, 45–60 min) + Farmer carries superset
FRI   Dead hangs + Push-ups + Deep squat (10 min maintenance)
SAT   Ruck (Zone 2, nasal, 60–90 min — longest session)
SUN   Rest — dead hangs optional, deep squat daily
```

### Rucking Prescription (Male)

| Parameter | Phase 1 (Wk 1--4) | Phase 2 (Wk 5--12) | Phase 3 (Mo 4--6) | Maintenance |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Load (% BW) | 10--15% | 18--22% | 25--30% | 25--30% |
| Load (kg at 80 kg) | 8--12 kg | 14--18 kg | 20--24 kg | 20--24 kg |
| Speed | Nasal-constrained | Nasal-constrained | $\geq$1.5 m/s | $\geq$1.5 m/s |
| Duration | 30--45 min | 45--60 min | 60--90 min | 60--90 min |
| Frequency | 2$\times$/week | 3$\times$/week | 3--4$\times$/week | 3--4$\times$/week |
| Breathing | Nasal mandatory | Nasal mandatory | Nasal mandatory | Nasal mandatory |

: Male rucking progression {#tbl-male-ruck}

**Load progression rule:** Add no more than 2 kg or 10% per 2-week block. If nasal breathing collapses at new load, stay at prior load for another 2 weeks.

### Intensity Verification

Any of these confirms Zone 2:

- Nasal breathing comfortable throughout
- Can speak full sentences with minor breathlessness
- RPE 11--14/20 (Borg scale)
- Heart rate 60--75% HRmax (at age 41: HRmax $\approx$ 179 bpm → Zone 2: 107--134 bpm)
- Blood lactate < 2 mmol/L

### Farmer Carries (Male)

| Parameter | Prescription |
|-----------|-------------|
| Load (each hand) | 25--40% BW total (12--20 kg/hand at 80 kg) |
| Distance | 30--50 m per set |
| Sets | 3--5 |
| Rest | 90 seconds |
| Cadence | Slow, deliberate---upright spine |
| Progression | +2--4 kg total per month |

### Session Timing

Morning sessions are superior for hormonal longevity. Salivary testosterone is highest within the first hour after awakening (Taylor et al. 2016).

- **Preferred window:** Within 2 hours of waking
- **Post-session:** Protein + carbohydrate within 30 minutes
- **Pre-session:** Avoid fasting >12 hours before a ruck

### Male Nutrition Minimums

| Parameter | Target | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Protein | $\geq$1.6--2.0 g/kg/day | Sarcopenia prevention |
| Energy availability | $\geq$45 kcal/kg FFM/day | Below this, testosterone declines |
| Post-ruck carbs | Within 30 min | Glycogen resynthesis |
| Vitamin D | $\geq$2000 IU/day | Testosterone + bone metabolism |
| Zinc | $\geq$11 mg/day | Aromatase inhibition |

: Male nutrition targets {#tbl-male-nutrition}

---

## Plan B: Female Protocol (41-Year-Old Anchor)

### Physiological Context

A 41-year-old woman is in perimenopause onset territory. The critical window for BMD intervention is now. Studies of women with osteopenia/osteoporosis show effect sizes of SMD 0.73--0.85 at spine and femoral neck with weight-bearing exercise (Sánchez-Trigo et al. 2022).

::: {.callout-warning}
## Female-Specific PFJ Risk
Willy et al. (2025) demonstrated that females exhibit significantly greater peak, per-step impulse, and cumulative patellofemoral joint stress than males during load carriage (sex $\times$ load interaction p = 0.002--0.005, ηp² = 0.12--0.13), even after controlling for body mass, height, and quadriceps strength. Load progression must be more conservative for women.
:::

**Primary goals:**

1. Achieve osteogenic loading threshold---most time-sensitive intervention
2. Preserve or build lean mass against oestrogen decline
3. Maintain pelvic floor competence
4. Establish Zone 2 metabolic base
5. Ensure energy availability---RED-S is a genuine risk

### Rucking Prescription (Female)

| Parameter | Phase 1 (Wk 1--4) | Phase 2 (Wk 5--12) | Phase 3 (Mo 4--6) | Maintenance |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Load (% BW) | 10--15% | 18--22% | 25--30% | 25--30% |
| Load (kg at 65 kg) | 6--10 kg | 12--14 kg | 16--20 kg | 16--20 kg |
| Speed | Nasal-constrained | $\geq$1.3 m/s | $\geq$1.5 m/s | $\geq$1.5 m/s |
| Cadence | Self-selected | 100--110 spm | 110--120 spm | 110--120 spm |
| Duration | 30--45 min | 45--60 min | 45--75 min | 45--75 min |
| Frequency | 2$\times$/week | 3$\times$/week | 3--4$\times$/week | 3$\times$/week |

: Female rucking progression {#tbl-female-ruck}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Cadence Note
120 spm cadence during rucking attenuates peak vertical GRF---the single most protective adaptation for female-specific stress fracture risk. Use a metronome app for the first 4--6 weeks.
:::

**Female-specific load progression:** +2 kg per **3-week** block (versus 2-week for males). Joint pain is a hard stop.

### Pelvic Floor Considerations

Rucking at walking pace generates IAP comparable to standing from a chair---the lowest-risk activity profile. Primary risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse are parity and age, not exercise modality. Nasal diaphragmatic breathing simultaneously manages IAP via reflex co-contraction.

**For women with pelvic floor symptoms:**

- Reduce cadence and pace until symptoms absent
- Reduce load by 5% BW and rebuild slowly
- Prioritise diaphragmatic breathing
- Avoid breath-holding (Valsalva) during any loaded movement

### Female Nutrition (Non-Negotiable)

| Parameter | Target | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Energy availability | **$\geq$45 kcal/kg FFM/day** | Below this, bone resorption exceeds formation |
| Protein | **$\geq$1.6 g/kg/day** (ideally 1.8--2.0) | MPS declines with oestrogen loss |
| Calcium | 1000--1200 mg/day | From food preferred |
| Vitamin D | $\geq$2000 IU/day | Calcium absorption co-factor |
| Iron | Monitor serum ferritin | Ferritin < 30 µg/L impairs performance |
| Carbohydrate | $\geq$3--5 g/kg/day on ruck days | Supports energy availability |

: Female nutrition targets {#tbl-female-nutrition}

### Caloric Expenditure Reference (65 kg Female)

| Session | Load | Kcal Above Rest |
|---------|------|-----------------|
| 45 min ruck | 15% BW | ~215--240 kcal |
| 60 min ruck | 20% BW | ~340--380 kcal |
| 60 min ruck | 27% BW | ~390--440 kcal |
| 75 min ruck | 27% BW | ~490--550 kcal |

: Caloric expenditure estimates, 65 kg female {#tbl-female-calories}

::: {.callout-warning}
## RED-S Warning
A 60-min ruck at 27% BW expends ~390--550 kcal. This is not optional extra intake---it is mandatory replenishment. Track weekly ruck distance increases alongside caloric intake increases.
:::

## Age Scaling Guide

### Scaling Principles

1. **Load before speed**---achieving osteogenic threshold at lower speeds is safer
2. **Nasal breathing is the universal intensity cap**---self-scales to fitness at any age
3. **Recovery scales faster than decline**---in older cohorts, recovery matters more than intensity
4. **Minimum effective dose exists**---30 min $\times$ 3$\times$/week at 15--20% BW is the floor

### Decade-by-Decade Parameters

| Age Band | Max Load (% BW) | Speed | Sessions/Wk | Duration | Priority |
|----------|----------------|-------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **18--29** | 30--45% | 1.5--2.0 m/s | 4--5 | 45--90 min | Build bone bank |
| **30--39** | 25--35% | 1.5--2.0 m/s | 3--4 | 45--75 min | Maintain BMD |
| **40--49** | 25--30% | $\geq$1.5 m/s | 3--4 | 45--75 min | Hormonal longevity |
| **50--59** | 20--28% | 1.3--1.8 m/s | 3 | 40--60 min | Osteoporosis prevention |
| **60--69** | 15--22% | 1.2--1.6 m/s | 3 | 30--60 min | Fall prevention |
| **70--79** | 10--18% | 1.0--1.4 m/s | 2--3 | 30--45 min | Functional strength |
| **80+** | 8--12% | Comfortable | 2--3 | 20--40 min | Ambulatory independence |

: Decade-by-decade scaling parameters {#tbl-decades}

### Sex-Specific Modifiers

| Life Phase | Female | Male |
|------------|--------|------|
| **Perimenopause** (45--52) | +0.2 g/kg/day protein; reduce max load 5% during high-symptom weeks; prioritise calcium | Watch T/C ratio if adding endurance volume |
| **Post-menopause** (52+) | Osteogenic threshold absolute priority; PFJ protective cadence (110--120 spm) | Consider testosterone evaluation before high-volume increase |
| **65+** | Minimum dose: 30 min $\times$ 3/week at 15% BW; lighter farmer carries (5--10 kg/hand) | Same minimum dose; grip strength and VO₂max are leading mortality predictors |

: Sex-specific scaling modifiers {#tbl-sex-modifiers}

### Load Progression Formula (All Ages)

```
Starting load:   10% BW (always — regardless of fitness)
Progression:     +2 kg per 2 weeks (males) / 3 weeks (females)
                 IF nasal breathing remains easy throughout
Target load:     Age-band maximum (see table)
Deload trigger:  Joint pain, nasal breathing failing, soreness > 48h
Deload protocol: Reduce load 20%, maintain frequency, 2 weeks
```

## Movement Execution Standards

### Rucking Form

- Pack sits high, centred; hip belt loaded at iliac crest
- Shoulders retracted, not rounded forward
- Head neutral---ears over shoulders. *At 25% BW, forward trunk lean increases ~14° and forward head posture ~13° (Dahl et al. 2016); conscious correction required.*
- Stride shorter than unloaded; cadence compensates for speed
- Footwear: trail shoes or boots with ankle support at $\geq$20% BW

### Farmer Carry Form

- Neutral spine throughout---no lateral lean permitted
- Chest tall, not collapsed
- Arms straight---no bicep involvement
- Deliberate pace---loaded march, not shuffle

### Dead Hang Standards

- Full grip---not fingerboard
- Shoulders packed (slight depression/retraction)
- Breathe: long nasal inhales, slow nasal exhales
- Full bodyweight---feet off ground

| Phase | Target | Added Load |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Beginner | 2 $\times$ 20 s/day | BW only |
| Intermediate | 2 $\times$ 40 s/day | BW only |
| Advanced | 3 $\times$ 60 s/day | BW only |
| Loaded | 2 $\times$ 30 s/day | +5--10 kg belt |
| Maintenance | 2 $\times$ 30 s, varied grip | +10--20 kg |

: Dead hang progression {#tbl-dead-hang}

::: {.callout-tip}
Dead hangs are most effective within 60 minutes of a ruck---spinal loading followed by traction decompression.
:::

### Push-Up Standards

- Full protraction at top; full retraction at bottom
- Chest touches floor
- Elbows 30--45° from torso
- Posterior pelvic tilt throughout
- 3--5 sets, 2 reps short of failure, daily
- Tempo: 3-1-1 (eccentric-pause-concentric)

### Deep Squat Standards

- Feet shoulder-width, toes 10--30° external rotation
- Heels flat (or 1--2 cm elevation while mobility develops)
- **Active/passive hybrid:** Maintain ~10--15% volitional co-contraction of quadriceps, gluteals, and transversus abdominis
- 2--5 min accumulated holds per day
- Nasal diaphragmatic breathing throughout
- Cue: *"Hold like you are balancing a glass of water on each knee."*

::: {.callout-warning}
**Contraindication:** Acute meniscal tear, posterior cruciate ligament insufficiency, or Grade III--IV patellofemoral chondropathy---consult a physiotherapist before end-range loaded flexion.
:::

---

## Recovery Monitoring

### HRV Protocol

| Metric | Positive | Warning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Resting RMSSD (morning, supine) | Stable or trending up | Declining >20% below 7-day average, 2+ consecutive days |
| HF-HRV (%) | Trending higher | Prolonged suppression |
| Resting HR | Stable or declining | Elevated >5 bpm above rolling average |
| Nasal breathing | Easier at same load | Not improving after 8 weeks |

: HRV recovery markers {#tbl-hrv}

**Tools:** Consumer HRV apps (HRV4Training, Elite HRV) with a 60-second morning measurement, supine, before rising.

### Subjective Markers

| Signal | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Muscle soreness > 48h | Rest; do not ruck until resolved |
| Persistent fatigue | Evaluate energy availability |
| Motivation collapse | Likely hormonal; reduce volume 25% for 1--2 weeks |
| Grip strength decline | Systemic fatigue; deload week |

: Subjective recovery markers {#tbl-subjective}

**Deload protocol:** Every 4th week, reduce load 20% and duration 25%. Maintain frequency. This is when structural adaptation occurs.

---

## Minimum Viable Protocol

For the time-constrained beginner:

| Movement | Frequency | Duration |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Ruck | 3$\times$/week | 30 min at 15--20% BW, nasal |
| Dead hangs | Daily | 2 $\times$ 20 s |
| Deep squat | Daily | 2 min accumulated |

: Minimum viable protocol {#tbl-mvp}

**Total weekly investment: ~100 minutes.** This is the floor. Below this, osteogenic and cardiovascular benefits are unlikely to accumulate.

---

## Red Flags: Stop and Assess {.unnumbered}

**Read this section carefully. Return to it if anything feels wrong. These criteria exist to keep you training for decades, not weeks.**

::: {.callout-warning}
## Stop Training If:

- **Joint pain** (not muscle soreness) during or after rucking → reduce load 25%, assess gait
- **Shin pain** with rucking (tibial stress) → reduce load, reduce speed, assess footwear
- **Pelvic floor symptoms** (leakage, pressure) during rucking → reduce load, assess breathing
- **Persistent fatigue** >72h after sessions → energy deficit; increase calories before reducing training
- **Nasal breathing never improves** after 12 weeks → assess for nasal polyps, deviated septum, rhinitis
- **Male: libido decline, morning erection changes** → testosterone panel warranted; evaluate EHMC
- **HRV declining** >2 consecutive weeks → structured deload and nutritional audit

## The Adaptation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | What Happens |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Nasal adaptation** | Weeks 1--8 | Discomfort, pace drops 20--30%. Normal. Do not abort. |
| **Load tolerance** | Weeks 4--12 | Posterior chain strengthens; paraspinal CSA increases |
| **Osteogenic accumulation** | Months 3--6 | BMD response begins; not yet measurable |
| **Hormonal steady state** | Months 2--4 | T/C ratio stabilises |
| **Cardiovascular adaptation** | Months 1--3 | Parasympathetic HRV metrics increase (p < 0.03) |
| **Full adaptation** | Month 6+ | Nasal breathing at target load feels natural |
| **Longevity dividend** | Years 3--5+ | BMD gains measurable by DEXA; grip maintained |

## Evidence Gaps

| Claim | Evidence Status | Gap |
|-------|----------------|-----|
| Rucking vs running testosterone | Indirect inference | Direct crossover RCT needed |
| IVD hydration from rucking | No direct evidence | Prospective MRI studies needed |
| Women 40--60+ biomechanics | Critical gap | Dedicated gait analysis needed |
| Min. dose for dynapenia 65+ | No RCT exists | Dose-response study needed |
| Nasal breathing + rucking | Mechanistic inference | Crossover study needed |
| RER/fat oxidation | Mixed evidence | Walking-specific RER studies needed |
| Chronic CV in older ruckers | Minimal | RCTs in 50+ needed |
