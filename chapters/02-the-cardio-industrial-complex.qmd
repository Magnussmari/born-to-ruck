# The Cardio Industrial Complex {#sec-cardio-complex}

Consider, for a moment, the sheer architectural ambition of the modern gymnasium. Not the squat cage or the pull-up bar---those are accidental survivals from an earlier, less profitable era---but the cardiovascular floor: the rows of treadmills with their built-in touchscreens and streaming subscriptions, the ellipticals calibrated to measure exactly enough data to require a premium app to interpret, the stationary bikes with power meters that would have been considered elite racing technology a generation ago. Consider the supplement shelf at the entrance: creatine monohydrate next to proprietary blends with trademarked names, beta-alanine alongside something called a "neuro-activation matrix," protein powders priced at the cost per gram of a decent steak but branded with the face of someone whose physique owes considerably more to pharmacology than to the powder they are endorsing. Consider the personal training packages displayed at the front desk, the periodisation apps that will, for a monthly fee, tell you exactly which muscle group to exhaust on which day of a twelve-week macrocycle designed by an algorithm that has never met your body.

Consider all of this, and then ask the single question that the fitness industry has invested heavily in making you too overwhelmed, too intimidated, or too grateful for guidance to ask: does any of it work better than going outside with a pack on your back?

Before answering that question, a clarification worth making at the outset: the fitness industry has produced genuine good. Millions of people who would otherwise be entirely sedentary are exercising because a gym opened near them, because a Peloton arrived during a pandemic, because a HIIT class gave them a community they would not otherwise have found. That is not nothing. The critique that follows is not a claim that the industry is malicious, or that its practitioners are cynical, or that the people who built these businesses intended harm. The critique is structural. The economic logic of an industry that generates revenue from complexity, subscription, and novelty has systematically distorted exercise recommendations away from what the evolutionary and biomechanical evidence supports. The problem is not conspiracy. It is incentive.

The honest answer to the question above, and the one that would immolate a substantial portion of the global wellness economy if it were widely understood, is no.

The story of how Western culture arrived at this particular impasse begins, as so many American stories do, with a military officer and a best-selling book.

In 1968, Kenneth H. Cooper---a United States Air Force physician who had spent years testing the cardiovascular fitness of pilots and astronauts---published *Aerobics*, a slim volume that would reshape how an entire civilisation thought about exercise. Cooper's central argument was deceptively simple: the cardiovascular system is a machine, and like all machines it requires regular running to maintain operational efficiency. He had developed a twelve-minute run test to quantify cardiovascular capacity, assembled longitudinal data on Air Force personnel, and proposed a point-based system whereby different activities generated different aerobic credits, and a sufficient accumulation of weekly credits---achieved most efficiently through sustained rhythmic cardio, and most efficiently of all through running---would produce measurable improvements in what he called "aerobic capacity." His laboratory was the United States military. His sample size, by the standards of 1968, was enormous. His conclusions were presented with the authority of a man who wore a uniform and held a medical degree.

*Aerobics* sold three million copies. By 1970 it had been translated into seventeen languages. Cooper followed it with *The New Aerobics* in 1970 and *Aerobics for Women* in 1972, co-authored with his wife Millie. He founded the Cooper Aerobics Centre in Dallas in 1970, which eventually became the Cooper Institute---a non-profit research organization that would go on to generate foundational data on cardiovascular fitness and mortality, including the landmark studies linking VO2max to longevity that remain central to the exercise science literature today. The Cooper name became synonymous with cardiovascular health. In dozens of countries, the twelve-minute Cooper Test became the standard fitness assessment for military recruits, police academies, and school physical education programs. A single man's framework, developed in a specific institutional context---the physical fitness of aircraft crewmembers in the United States military---became the operating system through which an entire civilisation began to understand the relationship between exercise and health.

What happened next was not Cooper's fault, but it is instructive. The publication of *Aerobics* coincided almost precisely with the beginnings of the American running boom, a cultural movement that would reach its apex in the late 1970s and early 1980s and whose mythology was built on a set of claims that the subsequent four decades of injury epidemiology have largely failed to support. Frank Shorter won the Olympic marathon in Munich in 1972 and became the first major American running celebrity. Bill Rodgers won Boston and New York four times each between 1975 and 1980. Jim Fixx published *The Complete Book of Running* in 1977---it spent eleven weeks at number one on the *New York Times* Best Seller list---and made the argument, in prose suffused with evangelical fervour, that running was not merely good for you but was a kind of spiritual practice, a gateway to psychological transformation, a way of becoming, in some fundamental sense, a better person. Fixx died of a heart attack while running in 1984, at the age of fifty-two. He had undiagnosed heart disease that had been progressing for years. His death did not significantly dampen the running boom.

It should, perhaps, have prompted more scrutiny of the underlying architecture. Instead, the fitness industry---which by the early 1980s had begun to recognise the commercial possibilities latent in the American public's suddenly athletic aspirations---did what industries do when a trend is lucrative: it scaled the infrastructure. Running shoes became an engineering arms race between Nike, New Balance, Adidas, and ASICS. Running magazines proliferated. Race calendars expanded. By the mid-1980s, the half-marathon had become a mass participation event that attracted millions of entry fees annually. The marathon itself was democratised, its completion transformed from a mark of elite athletic achievement into a bucket-list item requiring training plans, gel packs, compression sleeves, heart rate monitors, and---for the more committed---a five-hundred-dollar pair of carbon-fibre-plated shoes.

The injury data, accumulating throughout this period, was rather less triumphant.

The epidemiology of recreational running injury is one of the most studied, most consistently alarming, and most consistently ignored bodies of literature in sports medicine. The numbers have varied slightly across studies conducted across four decades, but the central finding has remained stubborn: depending on the definition used, the measurement period, and the population sampled, somewhere between forty and eighty percent of recreational runners sustain at least one injury significant enough to interrupt training in any given year. A 2012 meta-analysis by Van Gent and colleagues, examining thirty-five studies, found overall incidence rates of between nineteen and seventy-nine percent, with the knee---specifically the patellofemoral joint and the iliotibial band---representing the most common injury site. A more recent analysis by Francis and colleagues in *British Journal of Sports Medicine* put the annual injury proportion among recreational runners at approximately fifty percent, a figure that has remained essentially stable for decades despite the enormous investment in biomechanical research, shoe technology, and gait analysis that the running industry has funded.

Read that figure again. Fifty percent. In any other consumer product category, a failure rate of fifty percent---a product that injures half its users annually---would trigger regulatory scrutiny, class action litigation, and an immediate withdrawal from the market. In the fitness industry, it triggers a new shoe design and a revised training plan, both available for purchase.

The mechanism is not mysterious. Running subjects the lower extremity to ground reaction forces of two to three times body weight at foot strike---compared to one to 1.5 times body weight for walking---with an impact transient, a brief spike in force at the moment of heel contact, that is absent in walking gait entirely. This impact transient generates loading rates that are directly correlated with stress fracture incidence, shin splint development, and the cascade of overuse pathology that fills sports medicine clinics every spring when the weather warms and the half-marathon training schedules resume. The human foot, ankle, knee, and hip are well-designed for walking under load. They are reasonably well-designed for brief sprinting. They are poorly designed for sustained repetitive heel-strike running at moderate speed over distances measured in kilometres, which is precisely what most recreational runners do on most of their training days.

None of this prevented the industry from growing. None of this prevented the proliferation of training programmes, the explosion of race merchandise, the development of an entire coaching industry premised on the idea that the solution to running injuries was, invariably, more running---but better running, more technically refined running, running with corrected form and appropriate periodisation and properly structured recovery weeks. The solution was never to stop running. The solution was always to become a more sophisticated runner. Sophistication, after all, can be sold.

By the early 1990s, a different scientific proposition had begun to challenge the aerobic orthodoxy. Izumi Tabata, a Japanese sports scientist working with the Japanese speed skating team, was investigating the training methods of the national team's coach, Irisawa Koichi, who had been using a protocol of extremely short, extremely intense work intervals separated by even shorter rest periods. Tabata's 1996 paper in *Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise*---"Effects of Moderate-Intensity Endurance and High-Intensity Intermittent Training on Anaerobic Capacity and VO2max"---demonstrated that four minutes of high-intensity interval work, structured as eight twenty-second all-out efforts with ten-second rest periods, produced VO2max improvements comparable to five days a week of moderate-intensity continuous training, while simultaneously improving anaerobic capacity. The paper was carefully hedged: the sample size was small, the subjects were trained athletes, the comparison involved a specific protocol design, and Tabata himself was cautious about the generalizability of his findings to recreational populations.

The fitness industry was not cautious. The fitness industry saw four minutes where the mainstream had been selling sixty, and it saw the possibility of an entire new product category.

High-intensity interval training---HIIT---exploded into mainstream fitness culture in the mid-2000s and reached saturation by the early 2010s. The appeal was obvious and commercially brilliant: the implicit promise that you could achieve the same or better results in a fraction of the time. Where steady-state cardio required forty-five minutes on a treadmill, HIIT required twenty, or fifteen, or---in the most aggressive marketing---seven minutes with the right app. The science supporting this claim was real but carefully selectively cited. Studies showing HIIT equivalence to steady-state training were prominently referenced. Studies showing elevated injury rates, poor adherence, and hormonal disruption at HIIT volumes were considerably less prominent in the marketing materials.

The injury literature on HIIT is less mature than the running literature, for the simple reason that HIIT became a mass-market product more recently and the longitudinal data is still accumulating. But the acute injury data is not encouraging. A 2018 study in the *Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research* found that high-intensity functional training---the kind popularised in commercial HIIT programmes---was associated with injury rates significantly higher than traditional resistance training, with the shoulder and lumbar spine emerging as the most frequently affected regions. The overtraining data is more robust: high-intensity exercise performed at the frequencies typical of HIIT adherents---three to five sessions per week, as routinely prescribed in commercial programmes---has been consistently shown to elevate cortisol, suppress testosterone, increase inflammatory markers, and disrupt sleep quality when sustained over periods longer than eight weeks in recreational athletes who have not developed the aerobic base required to absorb repeated high-intensity stimuli.

The adherence data is the most damning of all. HIIT programmes, despite their promise of efficiency, produce dropout rates that match or exceed those of traditional gym memberships. A review published in the *British Journal of Sports Medicine* in 2019 found that when HIIT programmes were studied in real-world conditions---not in supervised laboratory settings where participants are motivated by research participation---adherence rates at twelve weeks ranged from forty to seventy percent, meaning that between thirty and sixty percent of participants had discontinued within three months. The equivalent figure for outdoor moderate-intensity walking programmes in comparable populations was substantially lower.

Shorter workouts, it turns out, do not solve the problem of people not wanting to exercise. They just allow the industry to sell the promise of shorter workouts.

CrossFit arrived in the early 2000s as something genuinely different---or so its founding mythology insisted. Greg Glassman, a former gymnast and personal trainer operating out of a garage in Santa Cruz, California, built a fitness philosophy around what he called "constantly varied functional movements performed at high intensity." The CrossFit programme was deliberately non-specialised: it combined weightlifting, gymnastics, metabolic conditioning, and competitive elements in workouts---WODs, in the argot of the community---that changed daily and were designed to be scalable to any fitness level. Glassman was explicitly contemptuous of the aerobics tradition, of steady-state cardio, of the entire infrastructure of conventional gym culture. His critique of the mainstream was sharp and often accurate.

The CrossFit affiliate model was, in retrospect, a masterpiece of franchise engineering. By licensing the CrossFit brand to individual gym owners for a modest annual fee and providing minimal oversight of programming quality or coach certification, Glassman created a system that grew from one affiliate in 2001 to over fifteen thousand by 2015, with an estimated four million participants worldwide at its peak. The annual CrossFit Games, which began in 2007 as a competition in a Northern California ranch and grew into a televised international spectacle with million-dollar prize purses, provided aspirational content---a living advertisement for the transformative potential of the methodology.

The injury data was, from the beginning, a point of significant controversy. A 2013 study by Hak and colleagues in the *Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine* surveyed 132 CrossFit participants and found that seventy-three percent had sustained a training-related injury, with the shoulder and spine most frequently affected. A 2014 study by Weisenthal and colleagues found injury rates of 3.1 per thousand training hours---higher than most traditional strength sports but comparable to Olympic weightlifting. The CrossFit organisation challenged these studies on methodological grounds, and the methodological objections were not without merit: several early injury studies used self-selected samples with unclear definitions of injury severity. The subsequent literature has been more methodologically rigorous and has produced more nuanced conclusions, suggesting that properly supervised CrossFit training at appropriate volumes carries injury risk comparable to other high-intensity sports.

The more significant problem with CrossFit, from the perspective of population health, was never the injury rate at established affiliates. It was the dropout rate in the broader community, and the degree to which the intensity of the methodology served as a filter that selected for a specific demographic---young, already relatively fit, competitive, motivated by group dynamics and performance benchmarks---while repelling the majority of the population for whom the public health imperative of exercise is most acute: the sedentary, the overweight, the middle-aged, the elderly. The CrossFit community is genuinely exceptional at producing elite fitness outcomes in people who can tolerate elite fitness demands. It has never demonstrated meaningful efficacy at the population level, where the challenge is not extracting maximal performance from willing athletes but inducing and sustaining physical activity in people who do not currently exercise at all.

Peloton represents something different: not a new exercise philosophy but a new delivery mechanism for an old one, wrapped in the language of community, technology, and premium consumer identity.

The company was founded in 2012 by John Foley, a former president of Barnes and Noble who identified what he described as the inconvenience of boutique fitness classes---the scheduling constraints, the commuting time, the embarrassment of the beginner in a room full of advanced practitioners---and proposed to solve it by delivering a boutique fitness experience to the home. The core product was a stationary bicycle with a large touchscreen mounted at eye level, streaming live and on-demand classes taught by charismatic instructors in a purpose-built Manhattan studio. The instructors became minor celebrities. The community features---leaderboards, virtual high-fives, milestone badges---created a social architecture designed to convert exercise from a solitary obligation into a communal experience. The branding positioned the bike not as fitness equipment but as a lifestyle investment, a statement of values, a membership in a tribe of people who had chosen, as Foley put it in an early pitch, to be "better every day."

At its peak in 2021---accelerated by the global pandemic that had closed gyms and made home fitness both necessary and newly aspirational---Peloton had over 5.4 million connected fitness subscribers, a market capitalisation briefly approaching fifty billion dollars, and a cultural footprint that extended well beyond cycling into a broader discourse about technology, community, and the commodification of wellness. The company had by then extended its product line from the original bicycle to a treadmill, a rowing machine, and a strength training app, each priced accordingly, each generating subscription revenue in perpetuity.

The adherence data was less flattering than the market capitalisation. A 2021 analysis of Peloton subscriber behaviour found that median monthly ride count fell precipitously after the first three months of subscription---a pattern consistent with the broader gym membership research, which has repeatedly shown that the average gym member uses their membership substantially less after the first quarter than their purchase behaviour at sign-up would predict. By late 2022, with post-pandemic normalisation returning people to outdoor environments and physical gyms, Peloton's subscriber count was in significant decline. The company announced major layoffs, replaced its CEO, explored a sale, and entered a period of strategic retrenchment. The fifty-billion-dollar market capitalisation was revised, sharply and repeatedly, downward.

The arc of Peloton is instructive not because the company failed---by 2024 it remained a substantial business with millions of subscribers---but because its trajectory illustrates a structural property of the fitness industry that has repeated itself across every major trend of the past fifty years: the initial adoption curve is steep, driven by novelty, social proof, and the genuine appeal of the underlying product promise; the adherence curve is flat or declining; and the gap between the two is filled, perpetually, with new products, new modalities, and new promises of the transformation that the last product nearly but not quite delivered.

The global fitness industry generated approximately ninety-six billion dollars in revenue in 2023, according to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association. The global sports nutrition market---supplements, protein powders, pre-workout formulations, recovery products---was valued at approximately fifty billion dollars in the same year and projected to grow at a compound annual rate of eight percent. The wearable technology market, encompassing fitness trackers, smartwatches with health monitoring functions, continuous glucose monitors marketed to non-diabetic fitness enthusiasts, and recovery tracking devices, crossed twenty billion dollars in the fitness subsector alone. Add the periodisation app market, the online coaching industry, the race participation economy, the boutique studio franchise sector---the cycling studios, the rowing studios, the barre studios, the kickboxing studios, each charging forty to fifty dollars for a fifty-minute class---and the figure becomes almost difficult to process.

What does this money buy? In terms of population health outcomes, the answer is not obviously commensurate with the investment. Despite the proliferation of gyms, wearables, apps, and boutique studios across the past four decades, and despite the genuine and well-documented public health awareness of the relationship between physical activity and health outcomes, physical inactivity rates in the United States and across most OECD countries have either remained stable or increased during the period of the fitness industry's most explosive growth. The 2022 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee report found that only twenty-five percent of American adults met the recommended aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity guidelines---a figure that had barely moved in two decades. A 2023 Gallup survey found that sixty percent of Americans reported that they did not exercise regularly. These are not numbers generated by a lack of awareness, a lack of available products, or a lack of commercial investment in infrastructure. They are numbers generated by a structural property of the available exercise options: most people, most of the time, simply do not continue doing them.

Exercise adherence research is a specialised and somewhat melancholy branch of exercise science, dedicated to investigating why an activity that most people understand to be beneficial is nonetheless abandoned by most people most of the time. The findings are remarkably consistent across modalities, populations, and decades of study. The average new gym member--an individual who has presumably experienced sufficient motivation to overcome the psychological inertia of change and the financial commitment of membership--drops out within six months at rates that range from forty to fifty percent across studies. The dropout rate for structured exercise programmes in supervised research settings--where participant motivation is typically higher than in the real world---averages around thirty-five percent at twelve weeks. For unsupervised exercise programmes conducted in naturalistic settings, dropout rates at twelve months routinely exceed fifty percent.

The industry's response to this data has been consistent with the economic logic of any business that generates revenue from initial adoption rather than sustained use: the solution to dropout is always a better, newer, more engaging product. The failed exerciser is not someone for whom the fundamental exercise prescription was wrong. They are a potential customer who needs a different experience, a more compelling community, a more intuitive app, a more charismatic instructor, a more gamified interface. The possibility that the fundamental nature of the exercise being prescribed---its intensity, its artificiality, its disconnection from human evolved movement patterns---might itself be the barrier is not a hypothesis that the industry has a commercial incentive to investigate.

The irony that organises everything else in this chapter is arithmetically precise.

The exercise with the highest published adherence rates---outdoor walking, which consistently achieves twelve-month continuation rates of sixty to seventy percent in community-based programmes, compared to thirty to forty percent for gym-based exercise interventions---requires no equipment beyond functional footwear, no subscription, no facility, and no instruction. It generates approximately three hundred dollars in annual revenue per participant, in shoe replacement costs, compared to approximately fifteen hundred dollars for the average gym member who uses their membership sporadically, roughly three thousand dollars for a moderately engaged Peloton subscriber, and potentially five thousand or more for someone enrolled in a boutique studio. Walking is the cheapest possible exercise from the consumer's perspective and the least profitable possible exercise from the industry's perspective. This is not coincidental. The complexity is the product.

Add a backpack with fifteen kilograms of weight, and you have an exercise that produces metabolic output equivalent to jogging---eight to ten kilocalories per minute, according to the Pandolf equation---at ground reaction forces that remain in the walking range, with documented cardiovascular adaptations comparable to structured aerobic training programmes, with osteogenic stimulus sufficient to preserve bone mineral density in postmenopausal women, with posterior chain activation patterns that address the muscular deficits produced by sedentary modern work environments, and with adherence properties that appear to dramatically exceed those of high-intensity alternatives. The annual equipment cost for a serviceable rucksack and a twenty-dollar bag of play sand---a perfectly adequate load source---is under two hundred dollars. A single use. No subscription required.

The absence of rucking from mainstream fitness culture is not explained by a deficit of evidence. The evidence for loaded walking as a primary exercise modality is, as subsequent chapters will demonstrate in detail, substantially stronger than the evidence for most of the modalities that the fitness industry has successfully monetised. It is explained, instead, by the structural logic of an industry that requires complexity to generate revenue, and by the accumulated inertia of five decades of marketing that has persuaded the Western consumer that effective exercise is necessarily difficult, necessarily expensive, necessarily mediated by expertise, and necessarily delivered through a screen or a subscription.

The aerobics revolution gave us the belief that cardiovascular fitness required a specific protocol deliverable by a certified instructor in a purpose-designed facility. The HIIT wave gave us the belief that efficiency required intensity, and that intensity required guidance. CrossFit gave us the belief that optimal training required constant programming variation by a credentialed coach. Peloton gave us the belief that motivation required community, and that community required a forty-five-hundred-dollar bicycle with a subscription attached. Each wave arrived with a genuine scientific insight at its core. Each wave was then scaled into an economic structure that converted that insight into a dependency---a product you could not obtain without the infrastructure of the company that created it.

The backpack is a technology approximately sixty-five thousand years old, based on the archaeological evidence from Siberian cave sites where woven plant-fibre cordage was used to bind loads for transport. The human gait pattern that delivers you across terrain at Zone 2 intensity is approximately four million years old, calibrated by evolution for exactly the physiological demands that contemporary exercise science identifies as optimal for metabolic health, cardiovascular adaptation, bone density maintenance, and functional longevity. Neither of these technologies requires a subscription, a touchscreen, a certified instructor, or a periodisation app. Neither of them requires you to feel, even briefly, that you are performing a version of exercise scaled down from something that elite athletes do.

The frustration appropriate to this chapter is not directed at the researchers who built the science---Cooper, Tabata, and their successors were working in good faith within the logic of their institutional contexts. It is directed at the structure that captured their findings and converted them, systematically and profitably, into dependencies. The feeling that you have been sold something---that the complexity was engineered, the confusion was profitable, the dependency was the point---is not paranoia. It is pattern recognition.

You were not confused because exercise is complicated. You were confused because your confusion was worth money.

---

The transition from frustration to action requires one more piece of the frame, and it is the most structurally significant. Exercise adherence research does not merely tell us that people quit. It tells us something specific about what they quit, and when, and under what conditions they are more likely to continue. The variables that most robustly predict long-term adherence---across populations, modalities, and decades of study---are not, as the industry's product development logic would suggest, engagement features, community integration, or content quality. They are autonomy, perceived competence, and naturalness: the degree to which the exercise can be performed independently, without supervision or instruction; the degree to which the exerciser feels capable rather than inadequate; and the degree to which the activity feels like something a human being might naturally do rather than something a human being performs in compliance with an external prescription.

Walking---particularly walking under load, in outdoor environments, at self-selected pace---scores at the top of all three dimensions. It requires no instruction to perform adequately. It produces immediate, perceptible evidence of competence in the form of distance covered and terrain navigated. And it is, in the deepest possible sense, what human beings naturally do---what they have done for four million years, what their musculoskeletal architecture is specifically designed to accomplish, what their hormonal and nervous systems are calibrated to sustain.

The machine you have been sold is not the exercise. The machine is the apparatus of complexity surrounding it.

Put it down.

The trail is outside. The pack is simple. The physics are ancient.
