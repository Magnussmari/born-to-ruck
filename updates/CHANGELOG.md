# Changelog

All notable changes to *Born to Ruck* are documented here.

## [v1.2] — 2026-02-23

### Evidence Quality Fixes (from adversarial review)
- **Ch. 6 (Testosterone):** Added qualifier on Gaviglio et al. farmer's walk data — acute testosterone response is load-dependent; extrapolating strongman data to recreational rucking loads overstates likely effect
- **Ch. 8 (Nasal Breathing):** Qualified nasal breathing + core stability synergy as strong mechanistic inference, not established EMG-validated fact
- **References:** Fixed citation attribution — Calamai et al. (2024), not Eser et al., for VE/VCO₂ cardiac study

### Stylistic Polish (from peer review)
- **All chapters:** Eliminated repetitive AI crutch phrases ("Read that again," "This is not a metaphor," "Let that settle") — kept first occurrence, rewrote or removed subsequent instances
- **Ch. 8:** Added beginner nasal breathing ramp — CO₂ tolerance is trainable, practical progression from rest → unloaded walks → light load before enforcing the gate

### Balance & Tone Edits
- **Ch. 1:** Added acknowledgment that running/HIIT work for people who tolerate them — rucking is the better baseline, not the only answer
- **Ch. 2:** Tempered "Cardio Industrial Complex" rhetoric — problem is structural incentives, not conspiracy; industry has produced genuine good
- **Ch. 9:** Added Red Flags cross-reference callout at chapter opening — safety boundaries before progression protocols
- **Ch. 11:** Added framing for nutritional precision — "learn the numbers, internalise the pattern, then eat like a human being"
- **Ch. 14:** Added balance philosophy closing — not a guru book, no certification, no app, just a practice
- **Foreword:** Added Garmin/wearable balance note — two-year watch detox after Strava, now uses 30-day summaries, body comes first

### Added
- **Icelandic translation** — full book translated to Icelandic as `is/` subdirectory ("Fædd til að bera")

## [v1.1] — 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Ch. 11 (Feed the Machine):** New section "How to Eat This Much Without Panic" — practical caloric density strategies for readers transitioning from chronic under-eating, addresses fat-gain anxiety with metabolic adaptation science
- **Ch. 9 (The Pack on Your Back):** New section on footwear and foot mechanics — wide toe box, zero/low-drop soles, metatarsal splay under load, ankle support thresholds
- **New Appendix:** "Prompting Your Protocol" — template AI prompts for personalised load progression and nutrition targets using the Akureyri Protocol

### Changed
- **Ch. 1 (The Running Lie):** Softened anti-running rhetoric — running reframed as emergency/specialised gear rather than evolutionary mistake; acknowledges Endurance Running Hypothesis (Bramble & Lieberman) upfront
- **Ch. 8 (Breathe Through Your Nose):** Clarified Bohr effect vs. mechanical governor — at Zone 2 intensities O₂ delivery is rarely limiting; nasal breathing's true value is preventing threshold crossover

### Fixed
- Updated Gemini model reference from "3.1 Pro Preview" to "3.1 Pro"
- Corrected foreword: father's shoulder story (Magnus started, father finished; master stonemason details)
- Added .env and .py to .gitignore
