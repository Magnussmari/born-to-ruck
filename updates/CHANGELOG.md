# Changelog

All notable changes to *Born to Ruck* are documented here.

## [v1.1] — 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Ch. 11 (Feed the Machine):** New section "How to Eat This Much Without Panic" — practical caloric density strategies for readers transitioning from chronic under-eating, addresses fat-gain anxiety with metabolic adaptation science
- **Ch. 9 (The Pack on Your Back):** New section on footwear and foot mechanics — wide toe box, zero/low-drop soles, metatarsal splay under load, ankle support thresholds
- **New Appendix:** "Prompting Your Protocol" — template AI prompts for personalised load progression and nutrition targets using the Akureyri Protocol

### Changed
- **Ch. 1 (The Running Lie):** Softened anti-running rhetoric — running reframed as emergency/specialised gear rather than evolutionary mistake; acknowledges Endurance Running Hypothesis (Bramble & Lieberman) upfront
- **Ch. 8 (Breathe Through Your Nose):** Clarified Bohr effect vs. mechanical governor — at Zone 2 intensities O₂ delivery is rarely limiting; nasal breathing's true value is preventing threshold crossover
